 The mutant line is causing an arithmetic operation error, specifically a subtraction instead of multiplication. This error is likely to cause the method to behave differently than intended, potentially leading to incorrect game states or even crashes.

To generate a test suite that would kill this mutant, we need to focus on the following aspects:

1. **Edge cases**: Test the method with the minimum and maximum possible input values. In this case, the edge cases would be when the side length is 1 and when it's the maximum value.

2. **Consistency**: Test the method with the same input multiple times to ensure that the output is consistent.

3. **Corner cases**: Test the method with inputs that are not edge cases but are still unusual or unexpected. For example, test the method with a side length that is a prime number or a power of 2.

4. **Boundary conditions**: Test the method with inputs that are just below or just above the edge cases.

5. **Negative inputs**: Test the method with negative inputs, if applicable.

6. **Interactions**: Test the method in different contexts, such as when other parts of the code are calling it or when it's being called recursively.

7. **Error handling**: Test the method with invalid inputs or unexpected conditions, such as when the grid is null or when the tileAdded counter overflows.

8. **Code coverage**: Use code coverage tools to ensure that every line of the method is executed at least once during testing.

9. **Regression testing**: After fixing the mutant, retest the method to ensure that it's still working correctly and that no new bugs have been introduced.

By following these guidelines, you should be able to generate a comprehensive test suite that would kill not only this mutant but also other similar mutants that might arise in the future. Remember, the goal is to thoroughly test the method to ensure that it behaves correctly under all possible conditions.
