 First, we need to understand the original method and its purpose. The getNearestPower2 method calculates the nearest power of 2 for a given input value. It does this by finding the exponent of base 2 that is equal to or greater than the input value.

    To generate effective tests, we need to consider edge cases, boundary values, and error conditions. Let's start by identifying some test cases:

    1. Test with a value equal to a power of 2: 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, 16777216, 33554432, 67108864, 134217728, 268435456, 536870912, 1073741824, 2147483648.

    2. Test with values slightly below and above powers of 2: 1.5 * Math.pow(2, n), 1.5 * Math.pow(2, n) + 1, for n = 0 to 15.

    3. Test with negative values, zero, and large values.

    4. Test with input values that result in NaN or infinity.

    5. Test with input values that are not integers.

    6. Test with input values that are very close to a power of 2 but not exactly equal.

    7. Test with input values that are very large or very small compared to the maximum and minimum values that the method can handle.

    8. Test with input values that are close to the maximum or minimum values but not
