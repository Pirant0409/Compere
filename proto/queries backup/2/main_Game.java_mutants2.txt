 First, we need to understand what the original line of code does. The original line sets the default close operation of the JFrame to EXIT_ON_CLOSE, which means that when the user closes the window, the JVM will exit.

    Now, let's see what the mutated line does. The mutated line is a no-op, which means it doesn't do anything. So, the question is, how can we write a test case that would expose this mutation and cause the JVM to exit when the window is closed?

    To answer this question, we need to think about what would happen if the default close operation was not set to EXIT_ON_CLOSE. In this case, the JVM would not exit when the window is closed, and we would have a hanging application.

    Therefore, to test for this mutation, we need to write a test case that verifies that the JVM exits when the window is closed. We can do this by simulating a window close event and checking that the JVM exits.

    Here are the steps to write such a test case:

    1. Create a mock JFrame class that extends JFrame and implements a custom interface with a method to simulate a window close event.
    2. Create a mock GamePanel and GameController class.
    3. Write a test method that creates an instance of the mock JFrame, sets up the mock GamePanel and GameController, and calls the simulated window close event.
    4. After the window close event is simulated, check that the JVM has exited.

    By following these steps, you should be able to write a test case that kills the mutant and also covers other similar mutants where the default close operation of a JFrame is changed.
