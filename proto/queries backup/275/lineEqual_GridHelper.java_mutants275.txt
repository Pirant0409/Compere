 First, we need to understand what the method does. This method compares an array of expected tile values with an array of actual tile values. If they are equal, it returns true, otherwise false.

    Now, let's focus on the mutated line. The mutated line changes the return value from the original line to false. This means that the method will always return false, regardless of the input.

    To generate a test suite that would kill this mutant, we need to find test cases that would make the method return true under normal circumstances, but false with the mutated line. This is called a "unit test" or "code coverage" strategy.

    To generate such test cases, we need to understand the input and output of the method. The input is an array of expected tile values and an array of actual tile values. The output is a boolean value indicating whether they are equal or not.

    Let's start by generating some test cases for the normal behavior of the method. We can create test cases where the expected and actual arrays are identical, and the method should return true. We can also create test cases where the arrays are different, and the method should return false.

    Now, let's think about how the mutated line affects the test cases. Since the mutated line always returns false, any test case that would make the method return true under normal circumstances will now make it return false with the mutated line. This means that we need to find test cases where the method would return true under normal circumstances, but false with the mutated line.

    One way to do this is to create test cases where the expected and actual arrays are different, but we can manipulate them to make the method return true under normal circumstances. For example, we could create an array of expected values that is a subarray of the actual array, or we could create an array of expected values that is a rotated version of the actual array.

    With these test cases, we should be able to kill the mutant and ensure that the method behaves correctly under all circumstances. Remember, the goal is not just to test this particular method, but to develop a testing strategy that can be applied to other methods as well.

    To summarize, to generate a test suite that would kill a mutant, we need to:
    1. Understand the input and output of the method.
    2.
