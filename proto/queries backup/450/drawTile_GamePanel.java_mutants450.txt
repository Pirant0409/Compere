 The mutated line is causing an issue by subtracting 2 from the original line number. This indicates that the mutant might be expecting a different number of arguments or a different data type for the method call.

 To generate effective tests, follow these steps:

 1. Understand the method:
    - Identify the method's purpose and its input/output relationship.
    - Check the method's preconditions and postconditions.
    - Analyze the method's control flow and edge cases.

 2. Identify potential test cases:
    - Test the method with valid input values.
    - Test the method with boundary input values.
    - Test the method with invalid input values.
    - Test the method with edge cases.
    - Test the method with special cases.

 3. Create test data:
    - Create test data for valid input values.
    - Create test data for boundary input values.
    - Create test data for invalid input values.
    - Create test data for edge cases.
    - Create test data for special cases.

 4. Write test cases:
    - Write test cases for each test data set.
    - Use assertions to verify the expected output.

 5. Run the test suite:
    - Run the test suite and check for any failures.
    - If there are failures, analyze the error messages and update the test cases accordingly.

 6. Refactor the test cases:
    - Refactor the test cases to make them more efficient and effective.

 7. Repeat the process:
    - Repeat the process for other methods in the codebase.

 In this specific case, since the mutated line is causing an issue with the method arguments, you should focus on testing the method with different input values, including boundary and invalid values, to ensure that the method behaves correctly with the expected input.
