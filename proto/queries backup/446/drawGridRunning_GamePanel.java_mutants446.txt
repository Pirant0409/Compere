 First, we need to understand what this method does. It's responsible for drawing the grid of a game. It does this by iterating through each cell in the grid and either drawing an empty cell or a cell with a tile.

    To test this method effectively, we need to test all possible scenarios. Let's start by testing the empty cells. We can create a test case where we check if the method correctly draws an empty cell. We can do this by checking the color of the cell that should be empty.

    Now, let's test the cells with tiles. We can create a test case where we check if the method correctly draws a cell with a tile. We can do this by checking if the tile is drawn correctly and in the correct position.

    To ensure comprehensive testing, we also need to test the edge cases. For example, we can test what happens when the grid size is 0 or when the grid size is very large. We can also test what happens when the controller returns a null tile or an invalid tile.

    To test for the mutated line, we need to understand what it does. It's a no-op statement, which means it doesn't do anything. However, it could potentially hide a bug in the code. For example, if the method relies on the size of the rectangle being exactly 106x106 pixels, this no-op statement could be hiding a bug where the size is incorrect.

    To test for this, we can create a test case where we check the size of the rectangle being drawn. We can do this by checking the width and height of the rectangle after it's drawn. If the size is not 106x106 pixels, then the mutated line is hiding a bug.

    In general, to generate effective test suites, we need to test all possible scenarios, including edge cases and negative scenarios. We also need to test for any potential bugs that could be hidden by no-op statements or other seemingly harmless code changes.

    To test for other mutants, we would follow a similar process. We would understand the method and its responsibilities, create test cases for all possible scenarios, and check for any potential bugs that could be hiding in the code.

    Remember, the goal is to ensure that the code is functioning correctly and that any changes or mutations do not introduce new bugs or
