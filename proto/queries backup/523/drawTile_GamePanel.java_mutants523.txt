 The mutated line is calculating the horizontal space for the string to be drawn, but it's doing it incorrectly. Instead of dividing the available width by 2 to get the space for the string on each side, it's multiplying the available width by 2. This will result in the string being drawn too far to the left or right, depending on the string length.

    To create a test suite that would kill this mutant, you should focus on creating test cases that cover different string lengths and positions. Here's a general approach:

    1. Create a test case that checks the drawing of a single character string. This test case should verify that the character is drawn in the center of the tile.
    2. Create a test case that checks the drawing of a long string. This test case should verify that the string is wrapped correctly and drawn within the tile boundaries.
    3. Create a test case that checks the drawing of a string at the edge of the grid. This test case should verify that the string is drawn correctly even when there is limited space on the side.
    4. Create a test case that checks the drawing of strings with different character sets. This test case should verify that the string is drawn correctly regardless of the characters used.
    5. Create a test case that checks the drawing of strings with different fonts. This test case should verify that the string is drawn correctly regardless of the font used.

    By creating test cases that cover different string lengths, positions, and character sets, you will be able to effectively test the `drawTile` method and ensure that the mutant is killed. Remember, the goal is to create a comprehensive test suite that covers as many edge cases as possible.
