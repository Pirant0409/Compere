 The mutant line changes the starting x-coordinate of the grid drawing from 215 to -215. This means that the grid is being drawn outside the visible area of the window. To create a test suite that would kill this mutant, we need to write tests that check the following:

    1. The grid is being drawn within the visible area of the window.
    2. The grid dimensions are correct.
    3. The grid colors are correct.
    4. The game state messages are displayed correctly based on the game state.

To write tests for these checks, we can use JUnit and Mockito. Here's a general idea of how to approach this:

Step 1: Create a test class for the `drawGridNotRunning` method.
```java
import org.junit.jupiter.api.*;
import static org.mockito.Mockito.*;;
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.*;

public class DrawGridTest {
    private Graphics2D mockGraphics;
    private Controller controller;

    @BeforeEach
    public void setup() {
        mockGraphics = mock(Graphics2D.class);
        controller = new Controller();
    }

    // Test methods will be added here
}
```

Step 2: Write a test method to check if the grid is drawn within the visible area.
```java
@Test
public void testGridIsDrawnWithinVisibleArea() {
    // Set up the mock graphics to return a specific width and height
    when(mockGraphics.getWidth()).thenReturn(800);
    when(mockGraphics.getHeight()).thenReturn(600);

    // Call the method under test
    drawGridNotRunning(mockGraphics, controller);

    // Check if the grid is drawn within the visible area
    verify(mockGraphics, times(1)).fillRoundRect(anyInt(), anyInt(), anyInt(), anyInt(), anyInt(), anyInt());
    verify(mockGraphics, times(1)).setColor(ColorPalette.startColor);
    verify(mockGraphics, times(1)).setColor(ColorPalette.gridColor);
    verify(mockGraphics, times(1)).setFont(any(Font.class));
    verify(
