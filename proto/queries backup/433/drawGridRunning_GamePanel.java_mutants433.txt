 The mutated line is causing an issue because it's dividing the row number by 121 instead of multiplying it. This will likely result in incorrect x-coordinates being calculated for drawing the grid squares.

 To generate a test suite that would kill this mutant, we need to create test cases that cover the edge cases and normal cases of the grid size. Here are some suggestions:

 1. Test with a grid size of 1x1: This will ensure that the method is correctly handling the case where there is only one tile in the grid.

 2. Test with a grid size that is a multiple of 121 in both dimensions: This will ensure that the method is correctly handling the case where the grid size is such that the calculation of x-coordinates using the original line will not result in any rounding errors.

 3. Test with a grid size that is not a multiple of 121 in one or both dimensions: This will ensure that the method is correctly handling the case where the calculation of x-coordinates using the original line will result in rounding errors.

 4. Test with a grid size that has tiles in all positions: This will ensure that the method is correctly handling the case where there are tiles in all positions of the grid.

 5. Test with a grid size that has tiles in some positions and empty spaces in others: This will ensure that the method is correctly handling the case where there are both tiles and empty spaces in the grid.

 6. Test with a grid size that has tiles in the corners and edges: This will ensure that the method is correctly handling the case where there are tiles in the corners and edges of the grid.

 7. Test with a grid size that has tiles in the center: This will ensure that the method is correctly handling the case where there are tiles in the center of the grid.

 8. Test with a grid size that has tiles in diagonal positions: This will ensure that the method is correctly handling the case where there are tiles in diagonal positions of the grid.

 By creating test cases that cover these cases, we can ensure that the method is correctly handling the calculation of x-coordinates for drawing the grid squares, and that the mutant is killed.

 This approach can be generalized to other mutants as well. The key is to understand the behavior of the code and
