 The mutated line is using multiplication instead of division. This change could potentially affect the behavior of the method, especially when it comes to determining the color index based on the tile value.

 To generate a test suite that would kill this mutant, we need to focus on creating test cases that cover various edge cases and boundary values. Here's a general approach:

 1. Identify the input domain: In this case, the input domain is the grid coordinates (r, c). We need to test various valid and invalid values for these coordinates.

 2. Test edge cases: We should test the minimum and maximum valid values for r and c, as well as values just below and above these limits.

 3. Test boundary values: We should test values that are very close to the edge cases but still within the valid input domain.

 4. Test invalid inputs: We should test values that are outside the valid input domain, such as negative numbers or values that are too large for the grid size.

 5. Test special cases: We should test values that have specific properties, such as the minimum or maximum tile value, or values that result in edge cases for the colorPaletteIndex calculation.

 6. Test the effect of the mutation on the output: We should test the method's output for various input values and compare it to the expected output. If the mutated version produces different results than the original, we have found a test case that kills the mutant.

 7. Refactor and repeat: If necessary, refactor the test cases to make them more concise or easier to understand. Then, repeat the process for other mutants.

 Remember, the goal is to create a comprehensive test suite that covers as many edge cases, boundary values, and special cases as possible. This will help ensure the correctness and robustness of the code.
