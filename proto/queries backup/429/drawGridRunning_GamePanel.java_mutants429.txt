 The mutated line changes the sign of the number 121 to -121. This means that the x-coordinate of the fillRoundRect method call will be decreased by 121 pixels. Since the x-coordinate is calculated based on the column index, this will cause the drawing to occur outside the grid boundaries.

 To generate a test suite that would kill this mutant, you should focus on testing the edge cases of the grid drawing. Here are some suggestions:

 1. Test the case where the grid is empty: Create a test case where the grid is empty and ensure that no drawing occurs outside the grid boundaries.

 2. Test the case where the grid is at its maximum size: Create a test case where the grid is at its maximum size and ensure that no drawing occurs outside the grid boundaries.

 3. Test the case where there is only one tile: Create a test case where there is only one tile in the grid and ensure that it is drawn correctly and no drawing occurs outside the grid boundaries.

 4. Test the case where there are tiles at the edges: Create test cases where there are tiles at the edges of the grid and ensure that they are drawn correctly and no drawing occurs outside the grid boundaries.

 5. Test the case where there are tiles in the corners: Create test cases where there are tiles in the corners of the grid and ensure that they are drawn correctly and no drawing occurs outside the grid boundaries.

 6. Test the case where there are tiles in the middle: Create test cases where there are tiles in the middle of the grid and ensure that they are drawn correctly and no drawing occurs outside the grid boundaries.

 7. Test the case where there are tiles in diagonal positions: Create test cases where there are tiles in diagonal positions and ensure that they are drawn correctly and no drawing occurs outside the grid boundaries.

 8. Test the case where the grid size is odd: Create test cases where the grid size is odd and ensure that no drawing occurs outside the grid boundaries.

 9. Test the case where the grid size is even: Create test cases where the grid size is even and ensure that no drawing occurs outside the grid boundaries.

 By testing these edge cases, you will be able to cover a wide range of possible scenarios and increase the chances of finding a test case that will kill the mutant. Remember, the goal is to ensure
