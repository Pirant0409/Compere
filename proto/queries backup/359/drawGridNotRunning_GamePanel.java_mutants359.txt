 First, we need to understand the behavior of the method before and after the mutation. The mutation seems to be affecting the starting position of the grid drawing.

    To generate effective tests, we need to consider the following:
    1. Input validation: Check if the method accepts valid inputs and rejects invalid ones.
    2. Functional testing: Verify that the method performs its intended functionality correctly.
    3. Boundary testing: Test the method with extreme input values to ensure it behaves correctly at the edges.
    4. Edge case testing: Test the method with edge cases to ensure it handles unexpected situations gracefully.

    Given the mutation, let's focus on functional testing and boundary testing. We want to test the grid drawing functionality and ensure it starts at the correct position.

    To generate tests, we can create a JUnit test case with the following steps:
    1. Initialize the Graphics2D object and set up the controller.
    2. Call the method with valid input.
    3. Verify that the grid is drawn at the correct position.
    4. Call the method with boundary input values.
    5. Verify that the grid is drawn at the correct position for all boundary cases.

    Here's a general approach to generate tests for other mutants as well:
    1. Understand the behavior of the method before and after the mutation.
    2. Identify the type of mutation (e.g., assignment, arithmetic, logic, etc.).
    3. Determine the impact of the mutation on the method's functionality.
    4. Generate tests based on functional, boundary, and edge case testing.

    For example, if the mutation was an arithmetic operation, we would want to test the method with valid, boundary, and edge case input values to ensure the arithmetic operation is performing correctly.

    In summary, to generate a test suite for the given mutant, we need to focus on functional and boundary testing to ensure the grid is drawn at the correct position. For other mutants, we need to understand the behavior of the method before and after the mutation and generate tests based on functional, boundary, and edge case testing.
