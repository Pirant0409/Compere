 First, we need to understand what this method does. It's responsible for drawing a tile on the grid based on its value. The value is used to determine the color of the tile and its position on the grid.

    Now, let's focus on the mutated line. The mutated line is -115, which is significantly different from the original line 115. This change could potentially affect the method's behavior, especially when it comes to calculating the position of the tile on the grid.

    To generate a test suite that would kill this mutant, we need to create test cases that cover various edge cases and expected behaviors of the method. Here are some suggestions:

    1. Test with valid grid coordinates (r and c) that result in a tile value within the expected range (0 to maximum value).
    2. Test with invalid grid coordinates (r and c) that result in an out-of-bounds error or a null pointer exception.
    3. Test with tile values that are close to the minimum and maximum possible values to ensure the color determination logic works correctly.
    4. Test with tile values that result in colors at the boundaries of the color palette to ensure the color assignment logic works correctly.
    5. Test with tile values that result in overlapping tiles to ensure the drawing logic works correctly and doesn't cause any unexpected visual artifacts.

    By creating test cases that cover these edge cases and expected behaviors, we can effectively test the method and ensure that the mutated line (-115) is killed, as it should not be part of the valid code.

    Remember, the goal is to create a comprehensive test suite that covers various scenarios and edge cases to ensure the method behaves as expected and any mutated lines are killed.
