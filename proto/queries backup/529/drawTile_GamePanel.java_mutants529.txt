 The mutated line is calculating the x-coordinate of the string's drawing position. The original line is doing the same thing but in a different order.

    The mutated line is performing arithmetic operations inside the parentheses, while the original line is performing them outside. This can lead to different results depending on the input values.

    To generate a test suite that would kill this mutant, you should focus on finding test cases that would expose the difference in behavior between the mutated and the original lines.

    Here are some suggestions on how to approach this problem:

    1. Analyze the input data: In this case, the input data are the values of the grid tiles and the string widths. Try to find test cases with extreme values for these inputs. For example, try tiles with the minimum and maximum possible values and strings with very long and very short lengths.

    2. Check the boundary conditions: The mutated line seems to have a division by zero potential issue. Check if the string width is zero or very close to zero in any test case.

    3. Use a systematic testing approach: Divide the input space into smaller partitions and test each partition thoroughly. For example, you could test the behavior of the method for different ranges of tile values and string widths.

    4. Use a test case generator: If you have access to a test case generator, you could use it to automatically generate test cases that cover a wide range of input values.

    5. Use a test coverage tool: A test coverage tool can help you identify which parts of the code are not covered by your tests. Focus on testing the lines of code that are not covered to ensure that the mutated line is behaving correctly.

    6. Use a symbolic execution tool: A symbolic execution tool can help you explore the possible execution paths of the code and identify test cases that would expose the difference in behavior between the mutated and the original lines.

    7. Use a static analysis tool: A static analysis tool can help you identify potential issues in the code, such as division by zero, arithmetic overflows, and other types of errors. Use this information to guide your test case design.

    8. Use a regression testing approach: Run your existing test suite against the mutated code and identify any test cases that pass for the mutated code but fail
