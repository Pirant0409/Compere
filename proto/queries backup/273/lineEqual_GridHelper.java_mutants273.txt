 First, we need to understand the behavior of the original method and the mutated line.

    The original method `lineEqual` takes two arguments: an array of Integer expectedValues and an array of Tile lineTiles. It converts the Integer array to a Tile array using a map function and then checks if both arrays are equal using the Arrays.equals() method.

    The mutated line is a no-op (no operation) line, meaning it doesn't change the program's behavior. However, it can still affect the test suite.

    To generate a test suite that would kill this mutant, follow these steps:

    1. Understand the expected behavior of the method:
       - The method should return true if both arrays have the same length and the corresponding elements are equal.
       - The method should return false otherwise.

    2. Create test cases that cover different scenarios:
       - Test case 1: Both arrays have the same length and the same elements.
       - Test case 2: Both arrays have the same length but different elements.
       - Test case 3: One array has a longer length than the other.
       - Test case 4: One array has a shorter length than the other.
       - Test case 5: One array contains null values, and the other doesn't.
       - Test case 6: One array contains Tile objects, and the other contains Integer values.

    3. Write test cases using JUnit:
       - Import the necessary libraries: `import org.junit.Assert.*;` and `import org.junit.Test;`.
       - Create a test class: `public class LineEqualTest { ... }`.
       - Write test methods for each test case.

    4. Run the test suite and observe the results:
       - If the test suite passes, add more test cases to cover edge cases and negative scenarios.
       - If the test suite fails, analyze the failure and modify the test cases accordingly.

    5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until the test suite passes for all test cases.

    6. Once the test suite passes, the mutant is dead.

    Remember, the goal is to create a comprehensive test suite that covers all possible scenarios and edge cases. This will help ensure the code's correctness and robustness
