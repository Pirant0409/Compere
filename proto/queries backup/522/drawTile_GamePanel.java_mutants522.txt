 The mutated line is causing an issue with the horizontal alignment of the string "s" that is being drawn on the tile. The original line is dividing the difference between the total width of the tile and the width of the string by 2 to center the string horizontally. The mutated line is taking the modulus instead of the division operation, which means it's calculating the remainder of the division. This can lead to the string being misaligned to the left or right depending on the length of the string.

 To generate a test suite that would kill this mutant, you would want to create test cases that cover various string lengths and test the horizontal alignment of the drawn strings. Here's a general approach:

1. Create a test case for a string of length 1. This should ensure that the string is centered properly when its length is odd.
2. Create a test case for a string of length 2. This should ensure that the string is centered properly when its length is even.
3. Create a test case for a string of length that is a multiple of 2 but not a power of 2. This will test the behavior when the string length is not a perfect square of some number.
4. Create a test case for a string of length that is a power of 2 but greater than 2. This will test the behavior when the string length is a square of some number, but the number itself is not 2.
5. Create a test case for a very long string. This will test the behavior when the string is much longer than the tile width, and will ensure that the method handles such cases correctly.

By testing various string lengths and checking the horizontal alignment of the drawn strings, you can ensure that the mutated line is causing a failure and that the original line should be used instead. This approach can be generalized to other mutants as well, as the key is to create test cases that cover various edge cases and test the behavior of the code under different conditions.
