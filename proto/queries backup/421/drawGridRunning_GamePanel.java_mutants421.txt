 The mutated line is causing the issue, so we need to understand what it does. This line is dividing the column index by 121 instead of multiplying it as in the original line. This means that the x-coordinate of the grid cell being drawn is being calculated incorrectly.

 To generate a test suite that would kill this mutant, we need to create test cases that would expose this incorrect behavior. Here are some general guidelines:

 1. Identify the boundary conditions: In this case, the grid side length is being used as a limit for the for loop. We should test the behavior of the method when the row and column indices are at their minimum and maximum values.

 2. Test with valid data: We should test the method with valid data, i.e., valid row and column indices that should result in a grid cell being drawn.

 3. Test with invalid data: We should also test the method with invalid data, i.e., row and column indices that are out of bounds.

 4. Test with different tile types: We should test the method with different tile types to ensure that the drawing of each tile is correct.

 5. Test with different colors: We should test the method with different colors to ensure that the correct color is being used for empty cells and for each tile type.

 6. Test with different graphics contexts: We should test the method with different graphics contexts to ensure that the drawing is being done correctly on each context.

 7. Test with different screen resolutions: We should test the method with different screen resolutions to ensure that the grid cells are being drawn correctly at different sizes.

 8. Test with different game parameters: We should test the method with different game parameters, such as different side lengths, to ensure that the grid is being drawn correctly with different dimensions.

 By creating test cases that cover these different scenarios, we can ensure that the mutated line is killed and the original behavior of the method is restored. Remember, the goal is not just to kill this particular mutant, but to create a comprehensive test suite that can detect and prevent similar mutants from arising in the future.
