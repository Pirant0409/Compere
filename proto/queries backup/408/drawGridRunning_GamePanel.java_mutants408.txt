 The mutated line is causing the method to draw beyond the grid boundaries. This means that the mutant is not checking the validity of the row index properly. To create a test suite that would kill this mutant, we need to test the boundary conditions of the for loop that iterates through the rows.

 First, we should create test cases that cover the minimum and maximum valid indices for the rows. We can do this by setting the side length of the game parameters to small values and passing these values to the method. For example, we can create a test case with sideLength = 1 and another test case with sideLength = 2. In the first test case, we should expect the method to draw only one tile, and in the second test case, we should expect the method to draw two tiles.

 Next, we should create test cases that cover the invalid indices for the rows. We can do this by setting the side length of the game parameters to a value greater than the expected maximum index and passing these values to the method. For example, we can create a test case with sideLength = 3 and another test case with sideLength = 4. In the first test case, we should expect the method to draw only two tiles, and in the second test case, we should expect an exception to be thrown due to an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.

 By testing the boundary conditions of the for loop that iterates through the rows, we can create a test suite that would kill this mutant and prevent similar mutants from surviving in the future. Remember, the key is to test the edge cases and validate the input data to ensure that the code behaves correctly under various conditions.
