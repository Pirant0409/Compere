 The mutated line is dividing the column index 'c' by 121 instead of multiplying it with 121 as in the original line. This change could potentially lead to incorrect calculations for the x-coordinate of where to draw the tile.

 To generate a test suite that would kill this mutant, we need to create test cases that would expose this division error. Here's a general approach:

 1. Identify the boundary values: Find the minimum and maximum valid values for the column index 'c'. These values should be within the range of the grid size.

 2. Create test cases for these boundary values: For each boundary value, create a test case where the column index is set to that value and observe the behavior of the method.

 3. Create test cases for edge values: Create test cases for column indices that are just below and just above the boundary values. These test cases will help ensure that the method behaves correctly when the column index is close to the boundary.

 4. Create test cases for random values: Generate test cases with random column indices within the valid range. This will help ensure that the method behaves correctly for a variety of input values.

 5. Verify the results: For each test case, check that the method correctly calculates and draws the tile at the expected location. If the method fails any of these test cases, then the mutant is alive and the test suite needs to be improved.

 6. Refactor the test cases: Once the test suite is able to kill the mutant, refactor the test cases to make them more efficient and easier to understand. This could involve grouping similar test cases together or renaming test methods to better reflect their purpose.

 Remember, the goal is to create a comprehensive test suite that can effectively identify and expose any errors or bugs in the code. By following this approach, you should be able to generate a test suite that can kill this mutant and help ensure the correctness of the 'drawTile' method for a variety of input values.
