 The mutated line is affecting the calculation of the y-coordinate for drawing the string. The original line calculates the y-coordinate by adding a constant value to the product of row and column multiplied by the tile size, and then adding the ascender and descender values to center the string vertically. The mutated line, however, is calculating the y-coordinate by dividing the sum of the constant value, product of row and column multiplied by the tile size, ascender value, and the difference between the line height and the sum of ascender and descender values, by the difference between the line height and the sum of ascender and descender values.

    To generate a test suite that would kill this mutant, you need to find a test case that would expose the incorrect behavior of the mutated line. One way to do this is to test the method with different input values for row and column, and check if the string is drawn at the expected position.

    To generate effective test cases, consider the following steps:

    1. Identify the preconditions: What are the conditions that must be met before the method can be called? In this case, the method requires a Graphics2D object, an integer row, and an integer column.

    2. Identify the expected output: What should the method return or produce as output? In this case, the method should draw a tile at the specified position with the correct color and value displayed.

    3. Identify the test data: Choose input values that cover different scenarios and edge cases. For example, test with negative row and column values, zero values, and maximum values. Also, test with different tile values to ensure the color palette is being used correctly.

    4. Design the test cases: Write test cases that exercise the method with the test data and verify the expected output. Use assertions to check if the string is drawn at the expected position and with the correct color and value.

    5. Execute the test cases: Run the test suite and observe the results. If the mutant is killed, the test suite is effective. If not, refine the test cases and repeat the process until the mutant is killed.

    Remember, the goal is to generate a test suite that can detect as many mutants as possible, not just this one. So, make sure your test cases cover a wide range of
