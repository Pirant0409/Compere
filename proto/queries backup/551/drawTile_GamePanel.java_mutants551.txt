 The mutated line is causing an arithmetic exception because the denominator of the division is zero or negative. This can only happen if the height of the ascender or the descent of the string is greater than 106.

 To generate a test case that would kill this mutant, we need to find a string that would cause this condition to occur. We can do this by finding the maximum height of the ascender and descent of all possible characters in the given font. Then, we can create a string with a character that has a height greater than the maximum height of the ascender and descent plus the width of the string.

 However, it's important to note that this is just a specific solution for this mutant. To generate tests that would kill other mutants, we need to understand the behavior of the mutated code and find inputs that would cause it to deviate from the expected behavior.

 In general, to generate effective test cases, we need to consider the following steps:

 1. Understand the behavior of the original code and the expected output.
 2. Identify the possible ways the mutated code can deviate from the expected behavior.
 3. Generate inputs that would cause the mutated code to deviate from the expected behavior.
 4. Verify that the mutated code produces the incorrect output with the generated inputs.

 By following these steps, we can generate test cases that would kill not only this mutant but also other mutants that may arise in the future.
