 The mutated line is causing the issue, so we need to understand what it does and how it affects the program's behavior.

    The original line is multiplying the column index by the width of a single tile to calculate the x-coordinate for drawing the tile. However, the mutated line is performing a modulo operation instead, which returns the remainder of the division.

    To create a test case that would kill this mutant, we need to find a specific input that would cause the incorrect behavior. Since the mutated line is causing the issue, we should focus on the column index.

    Let's consider the side length of the grid. If the side length is not a multiple of 121, then the modulo operation will return a non-zero value, which will cause the x-coordinate to be calculated incorrectly.

    To generate a test case, we can create a JUnit test with a setup method that initializes the controller and the GameParams with an appropriate side length. Then, in the test method, we can call the drawGridRunning method with a specific column index that would cause the incorrect behavior due to the mutated line.

    For example, if the side length is 122, then the column index 11 would cause the incorrect behavior because 11 % 121 = 11, which is not what we expect.

    To create a test case that would kill this mutant and other similar mutants, follow these steps:

    1. Understand the mutated line and its impact on the program's behavior.
    2. Find a specific input that would cause the incorrect behavior due to the mutated line.
    3. Create a JUnit test with a setup method that initializes the necessary objects with the input that would cause the incorrect behavior.
    4. In the test method, call the method under test with the input that would cause the incorrect behavior.
    5. Assert that the incorrect behavior occurred, such as an exception being thrown or the output being incorrect.

    By following these steps, you can create a test case that would kill this mutant and other similar mutants that may arise in the future.
