 The mutated line is causing an arithmetic operation that is not present in the original code. This operation is dividing the current position by the product of step and nextPosIncr. This means that the mutated method is trying to calculate a position based on a division instead of an addition.

    To create a test case that would kill this mutant, we need to understand the behavior of the original method and how the mutation is changing it. The original method is moving a tile from one position to another based on the given steps and increments. It checks if the next position is available for merging or not before moving the tile.

    The mutated method, on the other hand, is trying to calculate a position based on a division. This is not valid in the context of the original method. To create a test case that would kill this mutant, we need to provide input that would cause the division by zero or an invalid position calculation.

    Here are the steps to create a test case:

    1. Identify the edge cases: In the original method, the start position and last position are given as input. We need to test the method with the minimum and maximum possible values for these inputs. We also need to test the method when the start position is equal to the last position.

    2. Test for division by zero: Since the mutated line contains a division operation, we need to test the method with inputs that would cause a division by zero. This can be achieved by setting the step or nextPosIncr to zero.

    3. Test for invalid position calculation: Since the mutated line is calculating a position based on a division, it's likely that it will calculate an invalid position. We can test this by setting the step or nextPosIncr to a large value or a negative value.

    4. Test for merging: Since the original method is checking for merging before moving the tile, we need to test the method with tiles that can merge and tiles that cannot merge.

    5. Test for grid boundaries: Since the method is moving tiles within the grid, we need to test the method with tiles that are at the boundaries of the grid.

    By testing the method with these inputs, we can create a test suite that would kill the mutant and ensure the correctness of the original method. Remember, the goal is to test the behavior of the method under
