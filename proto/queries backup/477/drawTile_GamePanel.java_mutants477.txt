 The mutated line is causing an arithmetic expression error. The original line, on the other hand, is adding a constant value to the result of the multiplication.

 To generate tests that can potentially kill this mutant, we need to focus on the part of the code where the mutation occurred - the multiplication operation. We want to test various edge cases and boundary values to ensure that the multiplication operation is working correctly.

 Here are some suggestions for test cases:

 1. Test with negative and zero values for r and c to check if the multiplication operation handles these cases correctly.
 2. Test with large values for r and c to check if the multiplication operation can handle large numbers.
 3. Test with values close to the boundary of the grid size to check if the multiplication operation correctly calculates the position of the tile.
 4. Test with values that result in an overflow or underflow to check if the multiplication operation can handle these cases.
 5. Test with values that result in a position outside the grid boundaries to check if the method handles these cases correctly.

 By testing these edge cases and boundary values, we can ensure that the multiplication operation is working correctly and that the mutant is killed. This approach can be applied to other mutants as well, focusing on the specific part of the code where the mutation occurred.
