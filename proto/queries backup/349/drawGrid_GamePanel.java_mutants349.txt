 First, we need to understand the original method and its behavior. This method, `drawGrid`, is responsible for drawing a grid on a Graphics2D object. It checks the game state and calls either `drawGridRunning` or `drawGridNotRunning` based on the state.

    Now, let's focus on the mutated line. The mutated line is the last line in the method, and it's the line number 499. In the original code, this line calls either `drawGridRunning` or `drawGridNotRunning` based on the game state.

    To generate a test suite that would kill this mutant, we need to create test cases that cover all possible scenarios and edge cases. Let's list some test cases that would help us achieve that:

    1. Test case for `GameState.running`: This test case should ensure that `drawGridRunning` is called when the game state is `GameState.running`.
    2. Test case for `GameState.notRunning`: This test case should ensure that `drawGridNotRunning` is called when the game state is `GameState.notRunning`.
    3. Test case for null Graphics2D object: This test case should ensure that the method doesn't throw any exceptions when the Graphics2D object is null.
    4. Test case for empty grid: This test case should ensure that the method doesn't throw any exceptions when the grid dimensions are zero.
    5. Test case for incorrect game state: This test case should ensure that the method doesn't call `drawGridRunning` or `drawGridNotRunning` when the game state is not `GameState.running` or `GameState.notRunning`.
    6. Test case for color change: This test case should ensure that the grid color is changed when the `ColorPalette.gridColor` is modified.

    By writing these test cases, we can ensure that the mutated line is behaving as expected and that the method is correctly handling all possible scenarios. If the mutant is still alive, it means that there's a bug in the implementation of the test cases or in the method itself. In that case, we need to investigate further and refine our test cases and the method implementation.

    Remember, the goal is to create a comprehensive test suite that covers all possible scenarios and edge cases,
