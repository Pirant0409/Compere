 First, we need to understand the behavior of the original method and the mutated one. The original method is supposed to fill the first empty tile with a value of 2 by default, but if the number of tiles added is a multiple of 10, it sets the value to 4 instead.

    Now, let's focus on the mutated line. The mutated line changes the value assigned to 'val' from 2 to some other value. Since this mutant has been kept alive by some test suite, it means that the current test cases are not able to detect this change.

    To generate a test suite that can kill this mutant, we need to create test cases that cover all possible scenarios and edge cases. Here are some suggestions:

    1. Test with an empty grid: Initialize the grid with no tiles and call the fillFirstEmptyTile() method. The expected result is that the method should fill the first empty tile with a value of 2.

    2. Test with a grid filled with tiles: Initialize the grid with all tiles filled and call the fillFirstEmptyTile() method. The expected result is that the method should return false since there are no empty tiles left.

    3. Test with a grid having only one empty tile: Initialize the grid with one empty tile and call the fillFirstEmptyTile() method. The expected result is that the method should fill the empty tile with a value of 2.

    4. Test with a grid having multiple empty tiles: Initialize the grid with multiple empty tiles and call the fillFirstEmptyTile() method multiple times. The expected result is that all empty tiles should be filled in the order they were encountered, with the first empty tile having a value of 2 and subsequent empty tiles having a value of 4 if their index is a multiple of 10.

    5. Test with negative and out-of-bounds indices: Initialize the grid with valid and invalid indices and call the fillFirstEmptyTile() method with those indices. The expected result is that the method should not accept invalid indices and should return false.

    6. Test with different side lengths: Initialize the grid with different side lengths and call the fillFirstEmptyTile() method. The expected result is that the method should fill the first empty tile with a value of 2 by default and should change the value to 4 when the number of tiles added is a multiple of 1
