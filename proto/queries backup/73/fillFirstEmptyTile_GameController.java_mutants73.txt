 First, we need to understand the behavior of the method. The method `fillFirstEmptyTile()` is trying to fill the first empty tile in the grid with a value of either 2 or 4, depending on certain conditions.

    To generate a test suite that would kill this mutant, we need to create test cases that would cause the method to return `false` when it should return `true`. Here are some steps to guide you:

    1. Identify the preconditions: The method relies on the grid having at least one empty tile and the `tileAdded` variable being less than the total number of tiles. We should test these conditions to ensure they are met before testing the method's behavior.

    2. Test the edge cases: Since the method is iterating through all the tiles, we should test the first and last tile positions to ensure the method behaves correctly.

    3. Test the conditions: We should test the conditions in the method to ensure they are met correctly. For example, test the case when `tileAdded` is a multiple of 10 and is less than the total number of tiles.

    4. Test the method's behavior: Once we have ensured the preconditions are met and the conditions are correct, we can test the method's behavior by providing various inputs and checking the output. For example, test the case when there is only one empty tile and the method should fill it with a value of 2.

    5. Test the method's behavior with incorrect inputs: We should also test the method's behavior with incorrect inputs to ensure it returns the correct error message or throws an exception. For example, test the case when the grid is null or the `sideLength` is negative.

    6. Test the method's behavior with boundary values: We should test the method's behavior with boundary values to ensure it handles them correctly. For example, test the case when the grid has exactly `sideLength * sideLength` tiles and there is no empty tile.

    7. Test the method's behavior with multiple threads: If the method is not thread-safe, we should test its behavior with multiple threads to ensure it does not produce unexpected results.

    8. Test the method's behavior with different tile values: We should test the method's behavior with different tile values to ensure it fills the empty tile with the correct
