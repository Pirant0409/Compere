 The mutated line is causing an issue by subtracting 121 instead of multiplying it. This means that the coordinates for drawing the tile are being calculated incorrectly.

 To generate a test suite that would kill this mutant, you would want to test the method with various input values for r and c, focusing on the edge cases and values that would cause the incorrect calculation of the coordinates.

 Here are some suggestions for test cases:

 1. Test with r = 0 and c = 0 to ensure the method correctly handles the origin point.
 2. Test with r = 0 and c = maximum value to ensure the method correctly handles the last column.
 3. Test with r = maximum value and c = 0 to ensure the method correctly handles the last row.
 4. Test with r = maximum value and c = maximum value to ensure the method correctly handles the last cell.
 5. Test with negative values for r and c to ensure the method correctly handles out-of-bounds conditions.

 These test cases should cover the edge cases and help identify if the mutated line is causing incorrect behavior. Remember, the goal is to generate a test suite that would kill the mutant, meaning that it would expose the incorrect behavior of the mutated line.

 In general, when generating test cases for mutated code, focus on the edge cases, boundary values, and out-of-bounds conditions. These test cases will help ensure that the code is behaving correctly and will help identify any incorrect behavior caused by mutations.
