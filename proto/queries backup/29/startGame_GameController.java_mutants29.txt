 First, we need to understand the role of the method `startGame()` and the mutated line. The method `startGame()` is responsible for initializing the game when it's not already running. The original line `resetData();` resets all the data associated with the game.

    Now, the mutated line is a no-op (no operation) line, meaning it doesn't do anything. This line has been kept alive by some test suite, which indicates that the test suite is not effectively testing the `resetData()` call.

    To generate a test suite that would kill this mutant, we need to focus on testing the `resetData()` method. Here are some steps to guide you:

    1. Identify the inputs and expected outputs of the `resetData()` method. This information can be obtained by reading the method's documentation, if available, or by inspecting the method's implementation.

    2. Write test cases that cover various scenarios. For example, you could write a test case that checks if all data is reset when the method is called, or a test case that checks if the method behaves correctly when called multiple times.

    3. Test the edge cases. For example, you could test what happens when the game is already running when `startGame()` is called, or when the data to be reset is in an unexpected state.

    4. Test the method's interaction with other parts of the system. For example, you could test how the `resetData()` method affects the `grid` object or other game components.

    5. Verify that the test cases cover the `resetData()` method's functionality thoroughly. This can be done by manually checking the expected outputs against the actual outputs, or by using automated testing tools.

    6. Run the test suite and verify that the mutant is killed. If the mutant is still alive, re-evaluate the test cases and adjust them as necessary.

    By following these steps, you should be able to generate a test suite that effectively tests the `resetData()` method and kills the mutant. Remember, the goal is to write tests that cover all possible scenarios and edge cases, ensuring that the code behaves as expected under various conditions.
