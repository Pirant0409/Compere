 The mutated line is -1, which means the method moveDown is being called with an argument that is less than what it is supposed to receive. This is a clear indication of an input validation issue.

 To generate a test suite that would kill this mutant, you need to focus on testing the input validation logic of the moveDown method. Here's a general approach:

 1. Create test cases with valid inputs: Test the method with valid inputs to ensure it behaves correctly when the checkingAvailableMoves argument is true or false.

 2. Create test cases with boundary values: Test the method with boundary values of the checkingAvailableMoves argument, such as true and false, to ensure it handles these cases correctly.

 3. Create test cases with negative inputs: Test the method with negative inputs, such as -1, to ensure it handles invalid inputs appropriately.

 4. Create test cases with unexpected inputs: Test the method with unexpected inputs, such as null or non-boolean values, to ensure it handles such cases appropriately.

 5. Create test cases with combinations of inputs: Test the method with combinations of inputs, such as true and 0, true and 3, false and 3, etc., to ensure it handles different scenarios correctly.

 6. Verify the test suite: Run the test suite and ensure all test cases pass. If any test case fails, analyze the failure and modify the test case or the code as needed.

 7. Repeat the process: Generate new test cases to cover other potential mutants in the codebase. Remember, the goal is to ensure the codebase is thoroughly tested and free of mutants.

 By following this approach, you can generate a test suite that would kill this mutant and help prevent similar issues in the future.
