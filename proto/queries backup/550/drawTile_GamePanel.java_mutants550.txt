 The mutated line is affecting the calculation of the y-coordinate for drawing the string. The original line subtracts the sum of the ascender and descender from the height of the rectangle, while the mutated line adds it. This difference in calculation will result in the string being drawn in a different position.

 To generate tests that can kill this mutant, we need to focus on the string positioning. We should test various input values for r and c that result in strings of different lengths and values. We want to ensure that the string is drawn in the correct position regardless of its length and value.

 Here are some suggestions for test cases:

 1. Test with a grid containing only one tile, with a value of 1.
 2. Test with a grid containing multiple tiles, with various values and positions.
 3. Test with a grid containing tiles with values close to 128, which will result in different colorPaletteIndex values.
 4. Test with a grid containing tiles with values that result in long strings.
 5. Test with a grid containing tiles with values that result in strings with special characters.

 The goal is to create test cases that cover various edge cases and ensure the correct positioning of the strings. By doing so, we will increase the chances of finding a test case that can kill the mutant. Remember, the key is to focus on the string positioning and test various input values that can lead to different string lengths and values.
