 First, we need to understand what the method does and what the mutated line changes.

    The method `rowEqual` takes a `Grid`, an integer `row`, and an array of integers `expectedValues` as arguments. It returns a boolean value indicating whether the tiles in the given row of the grid have the expected values.

    The mutated line changes the return value of the method `GridHelper.lineEqual` from its original boolean value to the constant value `false`.

    Now, to generate a test suite that would kill this mutant, we need to create test cases that cover different scenarios and edge cases. Here are some suggestions:

    1. Test with an empty grid: Create a test case with an empty grid and an array of expected values. The method should return `false` in this case because there are no tiles in the row to compare.

    2. Test with a grid containing only one tile: Create a test case with a grid containing only one tile and an array with the expected value of that tile. The method should return `true` if the tile's value matches the expected value.

    3. Test with a grid containing multiple tiles with the same value: Create a test case with a grid containing multiple tiles with the same value and an array with that value. The method should return `true` if all tiles in the row have the expected value.

    4. Test with a grid containing multiple tiles with different values: Create a test case with a grid containing multiple tiles with different values and an array with the expected values in the same order as the tiles in the row. The method should return `false` if any tile in the row does not have the expected value.

    5. Test with a grid containing tiles with null values: Create a test case with a grid containing tiles with null values and an array with expected values. The method should return `false` if any tile in the row is null.

    6. Test with a grid containing tiles with negative values: Create a test case with a grid containing tiles with negative values and an array with expected values. The method should handle negative tile values correctly and return the expected result based on the comparison of the tile values with the expected values.

    7. Test with a grid containing tiles with large positive values: Create a test case with a grid containing tiles with large positive values and an array with expected values. The method
