 The mutated line is causing an issue by adding an extra 121 to the y-coordinate when calculating the position to draw the grid. This means that the grid is being drawn slightly off-screen, which is likely causing the mutant to survive the existing test suite.

 To generate a test suite that would kill this mutant, we need to create test cases that cover the edge cases and boundary conditions of the method. Here are some suggestions:

 1. Test the method with an empty grid: Create a test case where the controller's grid is empty, and verify that the grid is drawn correctly with no tiles.

 2. Test the method with a grid of size 1x1: Create a test case where the controller's grid has only one tile, and verify that the tile is drawn correctly at the expected position.

 3. Test the method with a grid of size 1xN: Create test cases where the controller's grid has a single row with varying numbers of columns, and verify that all tiles in that row are drawn correctly at the expected positions.

 4. Test the method with a grid of size Nx1: Create test cases where the controller's grid has a single column with varying numbers of rows, and verify that all tiles in that column are drawn correctly at the expected positions.

 5. Test the method with a grid of size NxN: Create test cases where the controller's grid has varying numbers of rows and columns, and verify that all tiles are drawn correctly at the expected positions.

 6. Test the method with a grid that has tiles at the edges: Create test cases where the controller's grid has tiles at the edges, and verify that they are drawn correctly and do not overlap with the grid borders.

 7. Test the method with a grid that has tiles in the corners: Create test cases where the controller's grid has tiles in the corners, and verify that they are drawn correctly and do not overlap with other tiles or the grid borders.

 8. Test the method with a grid that has tiles in the middle: Create test cases where the controller's grid has tiles in the middle, and verify that they are drawn correctly and do not overlap with other tiles.

 By creating test cases that cover these edge cases and boundary conditions, we can ensure that the mutant is killed and the method behaves correctly for
