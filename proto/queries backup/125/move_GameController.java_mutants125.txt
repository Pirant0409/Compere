 The mutated line is causing an issue in the loop condition, which is causing the loop to iterate one more time than it should. This can potentially lead to out-of-bounds errors or other unexpected behaviors.

    To create a test suite that can kill this mutant, we need to focus on the following aspects:

    1. **Edge cases**: Test the minimum and maximum values of the 'step' variable to ensure the loop behaves correctly when it reaches the boundaries.

    2. **Invalid input**: Test the method with invalid inputs, such as negative values or values larger than the expected range, to ensure the method handles such cases appropriately.

    3. **Corner cases**: Test the method with values that are close to the boundaries but not exactly at them. This can help uncover any edge conditions that might be causing issues.

    4. **Interactions with other parts of the code**: Test the method in different scenarios and with different inputs to ensure it interacts correctly with other parts of the code.

    5. **Error handling**: Test the method when it encounters errors, such as null pointers or other exceptions, to ensure it handles them appropriately.

    By thoroughly testing these aspects, you can create a comprehensive test suite that can help identify and kill this mutant and other similar mutants that might arise due to similar issues. Remember, the goal is to ensure the code is robust and reliable, and testing is an essential part of that process.
