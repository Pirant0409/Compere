 The mutated line is causing an issue by using the modulus operator (%), which is changing the calculation of the x and y coordinates for drawing the tile. This means that the position of the tile on the grid is not being calculated correctly.

 To generate a test suite that would kill this mutant, follow these steps:

 1. Understand the expected behavior: The method `drawTile` is responsible for drawing a tile on the grid based on its value. The x and y coordinates are calculated based on the grid position (r, c) and the tile value. The tile's value is obtained from the controller's grid.

 2. Create test cases that cover various edge cases and normal behavior:
   a. Test with valid grid positions (r, c) that result in valid tile values.
   b. Test with valid grid positions (r, c) that result in tile values at the edges of the color palette.
   c. Test with invalid grid positions (r, c) that result in out-of-bounds tile values.
   d. Test with invalid grid positions (r, c) that result in negative or zero values.

 3. Create test cases that cover the mutated behavior:
   a. Test with valid grid positions (r, c) where the modulus operation changes the x and y coordinates.
   b. Test with various tile values and observe the position of the tile on the grid.

 4. Verify the test results:
   a. The test suite should pass for all valid grid positions and tile values.
   b. The test suite should fail for the grid positions where the mutated behavior changes the x and y coordinates.

 5. Refactor the test cases if necessary:
   a. If the test cases are too complex or redundant, refactor them to make them more readable and maintainable.

 6. Repeat the process for other mutants:
   a. Analyze the mutated code and understand its impact on the program's behavior.
   b. Create test cases that cover various edge cases and normal behavior for the mutated code.
   c. Create test cases that cover the mutated behavior.
   d. Verify the test results.
   e. Refactor the test cases if necessary.

 Remember, the goal is to create a comprehensive test suite that covers various edge
