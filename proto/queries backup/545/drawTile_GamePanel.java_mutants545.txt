 The mutated line is calculating the product of asc and dec instead of adding them. This change can lead to unexpected behavior in the test case. To generate a test suite that would kill this mutant, follow these steps:

1. Understand the method: Read the method name, parameters, and the code to get a clear understanding of what it does. In this case, the method 'drawTile' takes two parameters, 'g', 'Graphics2D' object, and 'r', 'c', integers representing row and column. The method is responsible for drawing a tile on the grid based on the value of the tile.

2. Identify the affected part: The mutated line is responsible for calculating the y-coordinate for drawing the string. In the original code, the sum of asc and dec is used, but in the mutated code, the product of asc and dec is used. This change can lead to incorrect y-coordinate values, which can result in the string being drawn in the wrong position or even outside the drawing area.

3. Create test cases: To generate test cases, you need to create different scenarios that cover all possible edge cases and negative test cases. For example, you can test the method with different values of r and c, including the minimum and maximum values, and values that result in different colorPaletteIndex values. You can also test the method with invalid input, such as null or empty parameters.

4. Validate the test cases: Run the test cases to check if they are able to kill the mutant. In this case, the test cases should be able to identify and report the incorrect y-coordinate value due to the multiplication of asc and dec instead of addition.

5. Generalize the approach: The steps mentioned above can be applied to other mutants as well. The key is to understand the method, identify the affected part, create test cases, and validate the test cases. This approach will help you in generating test suites that can kill other mutants as well.
