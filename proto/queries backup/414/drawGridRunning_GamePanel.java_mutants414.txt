 The mutated line is the starting point of the x-coordinate for drawing the grid squares. In this case, it's hardcoded to 215. This value might not be correct for all possible grid sizes and positions.

    To generate effective tests for this mutant, we need to consider the following:

    1. **Edge cases**: Test the method with the minimum and maximum possible grid sizes and positions. For example, if the grid side length is 1, the starting point should be 0. If the grid side length is the maximum value, the starting point should be close to the maximum x-coordinate of the screen.

    2. **Invalid input**: Test the method with invalid input, such as a negative grid side length or a null controller.

    3. **Corner cases**: Test the method with the first and last rows and columns, as well as the middle rows and columns.

    4. **Interaction between variables**: Test the method with different combinations of grid sizes and positions, and ensure that the starting point is correctly calculated based on the grid size and the current position of the grid on the screen.

    5. **Code coverage**: Make sure that all lines of the method are executed during testing.

    6. **Error handling**: Test the method with various error conditions, such as an out-of-memory error, a null pointer exception, or an IllegalArgumentException.

    7. **Performance**: Test the method with large grid sizes and high numbers of iterations to ensure that it performs well and doesn't consume excessive resources.

    8. **Consistency**: Test the method with multiple calls to ensure that it consistently produces the same output for the same input.

    9. **Boundary conditions**: Test the method with the minimum and maximum possible values for the grid size and the x and y coordinates.

    10. **Functionality**: Test the method with various combinations of tiles to ensure that it correctly draws the grid based on the tiles provided.

    11. **Usability**: Test the method with various user interactions, such as resizing the window or moving the grid, to ensure that it adapts correctly to the new size and position.

    12. **Security**: Test the method for potential security vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting attacks.
