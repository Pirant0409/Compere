 First, we need to understand the behavior of the original method and the mutated line.

    The original method `mergeWith` takes another `Tile` object as an argument and checks if they can merge using the helper method `canMergeWith`. If they can merge, the values of both tiles are added and the merged flag is set to true. The method then returns the new value of the tile.

    The mutated line changes the return value of the method to -1 when the `if` condition is not met. This means that the method will return -1 even if the tiles cannot merge.

    To generate a test suite that would kill this mutant, we need to create test cases that cover different scenarios and ensure that the method behaves correctly when the `if` condition is not met. Here are some steps to guide you:

    1. Identify edge cases: Start by identifying edge cases that can help expose the mutant behavior. For example, test the method with two tiles that cannot merge, and test it with two identical tiles.

    2. Test with invalid inputs: Test the method with invalid inputs, such as null tiles or tiles with incorrect data types.

    3. Test with boundary values: Test the method with boundary values, such as the minimum and maximum values for the tile's value.

    4. Test with a combination of inputs: Test the method with a combination of inputs to ensure that it behaves correctly in different scenarios.

    5. Test the helper method: Test the `canMergeWith` method thoroughly to ensure that it is working correctly and returning the expected results.

    6. Test the side effects: Test the side effects of the method, such as setting the merged flag to true, to ensure that they are being set correctly.

    7. Test the return value: Test the return value of the method in different scenarios, including when the tiles cannot merge, to ensure that it is returning the expected value.

    8. Test the method in isolation: Test the method in isolation to ensure that it is not relying on any external factors or dependencies to function correctly.

    9. Test the method in context: Test the method in the context of the larger system to ensure that it is working correctly in the real-world scenario.

    By following these steps, you should be able to generate a test suite that would kill the mutant and
