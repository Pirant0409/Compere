 The mutated line is calculating the vertical position of the string to be drawn. It seems like the mutant is trying to change the vertical positioning of the string by multiplying asc instead of adding it.

    To generate a test suite that would kill this mutant, we need to focus on the vertical positioning of the string. We can create test cases that would check if the string is being drawn at the correct vertical position.

    Here are some suggestions for test cases:

    1. Create a test case that checks if the string is being drawn at the correct vertical position when the value is a small number.
    2. Create a test case that checks if the string is being drawn at the correct vertical position when the value is a large number.
    3. Create a test case that checks if the string is being drawn at the correct vertical position when the value is exactly 128.
    4. Create a test case that checks if the string is being drawn at the correct vertical position when the grid size is odd or even.
    5. Create a test case that checks if the string is being drawn at the correct vertical position when the grid is empty or filled with specific values.

    These test cases should cover various scenarios and help us identify if the mutant is affecting the vertical positioning of the string. Remember, the goal is to create a comprehensive test suite that would cover as many edge cases as possible.

    In general, when generating test cases for mutants, focus on the part of the code that is being mutated. Try to create test cases that would check if the mutation is affecting the expected behavior of the code. Remember, a good test suite should cover various scenarios and edge cases.
