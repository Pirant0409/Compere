 The mutated line is causing an issue by incorrectly calculating the row number. Instead of dividing the position by the side length to get the row number, it's adding the side length to the position. This will result in the row number being off by one for every position along the edge of the grid.

 To create a test suite that would kill this mutant, we need to test the edge cases of the method. We want to ensure that setting a tile at the very edge of the grid does not result in an incorrect row number being calculated.

 Here are some test cases you could consider:

 1. Test setting a tile at the very first position in each dimension (0,0).
 2. Test setting a tile at the last position in each dimension (sideLength-1, sideLength-1).
 3. Test setting a tile at the first position in one dimension and the last position in the other dimension (0, sideLength-1).
 4. Test setting a tile at the last position in one dimension and the first position in the other dimension (sideLength-1, 0).
 5. Test setting a tile at the very edge of the grid in multiple dimensions (sideLength-1, sideLength-1), (0, sideLength-1), (sideLength-1, 0), (0, 0).

 These test cases should cover the edge cases and help identify if the mutated line is causing any issues. If the mutant survives these tests, you may need to add more test cases or refine the existing ones to cover other edge cases or potential issues.

 Remember, the goal is to create a comprehensive test suite that covers all possible edge cases and potential issues. This will help ensure the correctness and reliability of the code.
