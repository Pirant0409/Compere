 The mutated line is causing an arithmetic operation error, specifically a division by zero error. This error occurs because the expression (row * 121) is evaluated to zero at some point during the execution of the method. To generate a test suite that would kill this mutant, we need to find a test case that exercises this condition.

 First, we need to understand the context of the method. It's drawing a grid based on the size of the game board and the current state of the grid. The method uses a nested for loop to iterate through each cell in the grid. If the cell is empty, it draws an empty square. If the cell contains a tile, it calls the drawTile method.

 To find a test case that would cause the mutated line to evaluate to zero, we need to find a condition where controller.getGrid().getTile(row, col) returns null. This can happen if the grid is not initialized properly or if the controller doesn't have a valid grid.

 To test for the first condition, we can add a test case that initializes the controller with a null grid. To test for the second condition, we can add a test case that initializes the controller without setting the grid.

 Here's a general approach to generating test cases for other mutants as well:

 1. Understand the context of the method and the mutated line.
 2. Identify the conditions that could cause the mutated line to behave incorrectly.
 3. Create test cases that exercise those conditions.
 4. Verify that the test cases cause the mutated line to fail as expected.

 Remember, the goal is not just to kill this particular mutant, but to ensure that the entire codebase is covered by a comprehensive test suite.
