 First, we need to understand what the mutated line means. A <NO-OP> statement is a placeholder for a code that does nothing. In other words, it's an empty statement.

    Now, let's consider the original line. It's a call to the drawString method, which is used to draw a string at a specified position on the graphics context. In this case, the string being drawn is "Use arrow keys to move tiles" and it's being drawn at the position (310, 530).

    To generate tests that would kill this mutant, we need to find a test case that would cause the drawString call to fail when the <NO-OP> statement is present. One way to do this is to modify the string being drawn so that it's no longer a valid string. For example, we could try passing a null string or an empty string to the drawString method.

    However, it's important to note that simply modifying the string may not be enough to kill the mutant. The mutated line could be interacting with other parts of the code in ways that we don't yet understand. Therefore, it's important to write comprehensive tests that cover as many scenarios as possible.

    To generate a comprehensive test suite, we could start by writing tests that cover the normal behavior of the method, such as drawing the grid and the game state messages. We could also write tests that cover edge cases, such as what happens when the graphics context is null or when the font size is negative.

    Additionally, we could write tests that cover the interaction between the method and other parts of the code. For example, we could write tests that simulate user input by calling the controller's methods to set the game state and then verify that the correct message is drawn on the grid.

    By writing a comprehensive test suite that covers as many scenarios as possible, we can increase the chances of finding a test case that will kill the mutant. However, it's important to remember that testing is an iterative process, and it may take several rounds of testing and debugging to fully understand the behavior of the code and identify all the mutants.
