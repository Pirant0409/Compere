 The mutated line changes the constant value '215' to '-215'. This change could potentially affect the x-coordinate of the string drawing position in the 'drawString' method call.

 To generate a test suite that could potentially kill this mutant, you should focus on testing the boundary conditions and edge cases of the 'drawTile' method. Here are some suggestions:

 1. Test with negative row and column values to ensure the method behaves correctly when the input is out of bounds.
 2. Test with the minimum and maximum possible values for the row and column to ensure the method handles these extreme cases correctly.
 3. Test with values that result in the smallest and largest possible colorPaletteIndex values to ensure the color selection logic works correctly.
 4. Test with values that result in strings of different lengths to ensure the string drawing position is calculated correctly.
 5. Test with values that result in strings that are very close to the edge of the drawing area to ensure the method handles such cases correctly.

 By thoroughly testing these cases, you should be able to create a test suite that can potentially kill the mutant and expose the issue caused by the mutated line. Remember, the goal is not just to test this particular mutant, but to ensure the overall functionality and robustness of the 'drawTile' method.
