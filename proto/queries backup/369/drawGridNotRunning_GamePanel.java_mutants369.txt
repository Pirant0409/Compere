 First, we need to understand the behavior of the original method. The method is responsible for drawing the grid and some text on the given Graphics2D object. It checks the game state and based on that, it draws different text messages.

    Now, let's focus on the mutated line. The mutated line is empty, which means it doesn't contain any code. This is an unusual situation, but it's not impossible to create test cases for it.

    To generate test cases for this mutated line, we need to consider the following:

    1. The method is called with a valid Graphics2D object.
    2. The method is called when the game state is 'won' or 'over'.
    3. The method is called when the game state is neither 'won' nor 'over'.

    For each of these scenarios, we need to create test cases that verify the absence of any drawing operation at the mutated line. This can be achieved by checking the Graphics2D object's drawing history or by observing the output image.

    To generate test cases for other mutants, you would follow a similar approach. Analyze the behavior of the original method and the effect of the mutated line. Then, create test cases that verify the absence or incorrect behavior of the mutated line.

    Remember, the goal is to cover as many possible scenarios as possible and ensure that the mutated line doesn't introduce any unexpected behavior. This will help in killing the mutant and maintaining the integrity of the code.
