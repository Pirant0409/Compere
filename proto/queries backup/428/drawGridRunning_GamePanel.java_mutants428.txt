 First, we need to understand what this method does. It's responsible for drawing the grid of a game. The grid is represented by a 2D array in the controller, and each cell in the grid can contain a tile. If a cell is empty, the method draws an empty square. If a cell contains a tile, the method calls another method to draw that tile.

    Now, let's focus on the mutated line. The mutated line changes the constant value 121 to a variable. This could potentially affect the positioning of the squares in the grid. To create a test suite that would kill this mutant, we need to find a test case that would expose this issue.

    To do this, we can create a test case that checks the positioning of the squares in the grid when it's empty. We can create an array of booleans to represent the state of the grid and then call the method with this array as the controller's grid. We can then check the position of each empty square by calculating its expected position based on the grid size and comparing it to the actual position.

    Here are the steps to create the test case:

    1. Create a test class for the method.
    2. Create a private method to create a controller with a given grid state.
    3. Create a private method to calculate the expected position of an empty square based on its row and column.
    4. Create a test method that sets up the controller, calls the method, and checks the position of each empty square.
    5. Run the test and verify that it fails when the mutated line is present.

    By following these steps, you should be able to create a test case that exposes the issue with the mutated line and kills the mutant. This approach can be applied to other mutants as well, by understanding their behavior and creating test cases that expose their issues.
