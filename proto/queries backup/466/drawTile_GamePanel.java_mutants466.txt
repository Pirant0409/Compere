 The mutated line is causing an issue by subtracting the column index from the x-coordinate instead of adding it. This results in the drawing of the tile being shifted to the left for each column.

 To generate a test suite that would kill this mutant, follow these steps:

 1. Understand the method's functionality: The method `drawTile` is responsible for drawing a tile on the grid based on its value. It sets the color of the tile based on the value, and then draws the tile with its value displayed.

 2. Identify the input: The method takes two arguments - the Graphics2D object and the row and column indices.

 3. Create test cases that cover all possible edge cases and normal cases:

   a. Edge cases:
      i. Minimum and maximum values for the row and column indices.
      ii. Invalid values for the Graphics2D object.
      iii. Negative values for the row and column indices.

   b. Normal cases:
      i. Valid values for the row and column indices.
      ii. Various values for the Graphics2D object.

 4. Create test cases to check the drawing position:

   a. Test cases to check if the tile is drawn at the correct position based on the row and column indices.

 5. Create test cases to check the color of the tile:

   a. Test cases to check if the tile is drawn with the correct color based on its value.

 6. Create test cases to check the value displayed:

   a. Test cases to check if the tile's value is displayed correctly.

 7. Create test cases to check the behavior when the input is invalid:

   a. Test cases to check if the method behaves correctly when the Graphics2D object is invalid.

 8. Create test cases to check the behavior when the input is out of bounds:

   a. Test cases to check if the method behaves correctly when the row or column index is out of bounds.

 9. Run the test suite and analyze the results:

   a. If the mutant is killed, the test suite is effective and covers all possible scenarios.

 10. Refactor and improve the test suite as needed:

   a. Make
