 First, we need to understand the behavior of the original method. The method 'drawGridNotRunning' is responsible for drawing the grid and some text on the JPanel. It takes a Graphics2D object as a parameter and uses it to draw the required components.

    Now, let's focus on the mutated line. The mutated line has a value of -115 instead of the original value of 115. This means that the 'fillRoundRect' method call will be executed with incorrect x and y coordinates.

    To generate a test suite that can kill this mutant, we need to create test cases that can detect this incorrect behavior. Here are some steps to guide you:

    1. Create a JPanel subclass with a reference to the controller.
    2. Override the paintComponent method to call the 'drawGridNotRunning' method with a Graphics2D object.
    3. Create test cases that cover different states of the game and verify that the 'drawGridNotRunning' method is drawing the components at the correct positions.
    4. Create a test case that checks the position of the 'You win!' or 'You loose!' text based on the game state.
    5. Create a test case that checks the position of the 'Click to start a new game' and '(Use arrow keys to move tiles)' text.
    6. Run the test suite and observe the results. If the mutant is still alive, modify the test cases to make them more specific and cover more edge cases.

    By following these steps, you should be able to generate a test suite that can kill this mutant and prevent similar mutants from surviving in the future. Remember, the key to effective testing is thorough coverage and attention to detail.
