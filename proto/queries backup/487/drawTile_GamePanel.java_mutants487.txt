 The mutated line is causing an issue by changing the value of the radius of the round rectangle. This change might lead to the rectangle being drawn outside the grid or overlapping other rectangles.

 To generate a test suite that can kill this mutant, we need to focus on testing the correct behavior of the method when given valid and invalid input. Here are some suggestions:

 1. Test with valid input: Ensure that the method correctly draws the tile with the given row and column, using the correct color based on the tile value.

 2. Test with edge cases: Check if the method correctly handles the first and last rows and columns of the grid.

 3. Test with negative input: Ensure that the method does not draw anything when given invalid row and column values.

 4. Test with out-of-bounds input: Check if the method correctly handles input that is beyond the grid boundaries.

 5. Test with invalid tile values: Ensure that the method correctly handles tile values that are not valid (e.g., negative numbers, values greater than the maximum allowed).

 6. Test with overlapping rectangles: Check if the method correctly handles cases where two or more rectangles overlap.

 7. Test with different color palettes: Ensure that the method correctly uses the correct color palette based on the tile value.

 8. Test with different font sizes: Check if the method correctly handles different font sizes for the text inside the tile.

 9. Test with different grid sizes: Ensure that the method correctly handles grids of different sizes.

 10. Test with different graphics contexts: Check if the method correctly handles different graphics contexts, such as different colors or fonts.

 By thoroughly testing the method with a variety of input, we can create a test suite that can effectively kill this mutant and prevent similar issues from arising in the future.
