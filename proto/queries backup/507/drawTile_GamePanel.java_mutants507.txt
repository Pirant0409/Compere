 The mutated line is causing an issue by adding an extra 121 to the x-coordinate when calculating the position for drawing the tile label. This is causing the label to be drawn outside the tile's bounding box.

 To create a test suite that would kill this mutant, we need to focus on the following aspects:

 1. **Understand the behavior of the original method**: In this case, the method `drawTile` is responsible for drawing a tile on the grid with its corresponding value and color. The position of the tile label is calculated based on the grid position (r, c) and the size of the tile.

 2. **Identify the impact of the mutation**: The mutation is causing the label to be drawn outside the tile's bounding box. This can lead to incorrect or inconsistent visual representation of the grid.

 3. **Create test cases that cover the expected behavior**: To create test cases, we need to consider the different scenarios that the method should handle correctly. For instance, we can test the method with various tile values, grid positions, and grid sizes.

 4. **Create test cases that cover the unexpected behavior**: Given the mutation, we need to create test cases that would expose the incorrect behavior of the mutated method. In this case, we can test the method with grid positions that cause the label to be drawn outside the tile's bounding box.

 5. **Design test cases to be independent, repeatable, and verifiable**: Each test case should be designed to test a specific aspect of the method's behavior. They should be independent, meaning that the outcome of one test case should not depend on the outcome of another test case. They should be repeatable, meaning that the same test case should produce the same outcome every time it is run. And they should be verifiable, meaning that the outcome of the test case can be objectively determined and measured.

 6. **Use assertions to validate the expected behavior**: In Java, we can use JUnit assertions to validate the expected behavior of the method. For instance, we can use `assertEquals` to compare the expected and actual positions of the tile label.

 7. **Use test coverage tools to ensure test suite coverage**: To ensure that our test suite covers all parts of the code, we can use test coverage tools like JaCoCo or Cober
