 The mutated line is causing the x-coordinate of the rectangle to be calculated incorrectly. This could potentially lead to the rectangle being drawn in the wrong position or even outside the drawing area.

 To generate a test suite that would kill this mutant, you need to create test cases that cover the edge cases and boundary conditions of the method. Here are some suggestions:

 1. Test with empty grid: Create a test case where the grid is empty. This will ensure that the method is correctly handling the case where there are no tiles in the grid.

 2. Test with grid size of 1: Create a test case where the grid size is 1x1. This will ensure that the method is correctly handling the case where there is only one tile in the grid.

 3. Test with grid size of maximum value: Create a test case where the grid size is the maximum value allowed by the GameParams.sideLength constant. This will ensure that the method is correctly handling large grids.

 4. Test with grid size of minimum value: Create a test case where the grid size is the minimum value allowed by the GameParams.sideLength constant. This will ensure that the method is correctly handling small grids.

 5. Test with grid containing tiles at all possible positions: Create test cases where tiles are present at all possible positions in the grid. This will ensure that the method is correctly handling the case where there are tiles in the grid.

 6. Test with grid containing tiles at boundary positions: Create test cases where tiles are present at the boundary positions of the grid. This will ensure that the method is correctly handling the case where tiles are present at the edges of the grid.

 7. Test with grid containing tiles at corner positions: Create test cases where tiles are present at the corner positions of the grid. This will ensure that the method is correctly handling the case where tiles are present at the intersection of two edges.

 8. Test with grid containing tiles at diagonal positions: Create test cases where tiles are present at diagonal positions in the grid. This will ensure that the method is correctly handling the case where tiles are not aligned with the grid edges.

 By creating test cases that cover these edge cases and boundary conditions, you will be able to ensure that the method is working correctly and that the mutated line is not causing any issues. Remember, the goal is to create a comprehensive test suite that
