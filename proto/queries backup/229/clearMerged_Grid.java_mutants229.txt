 First, we need to understand the behavior of the original method and the mutated line.

    The original method, clearMerged(), iterates through all the tiles in the 2D array, and for each non-null tile, it sets its merged property to false.

    The mutated line, marked as <NO-OP>, is a no-operation statement, which means it doesn't do anything. It doesn't affect the execution of the method.

    To generate a test suite that would kill this mutant, we need to find a scenario where the no-operation statement causes the method's behavior to differ from the expected one. In other words, we need to find a situation where the absence of the line, tile.setMerged(false), leads to incorrect behavior.

    To do this, we should consider the following steps:

    1. Identify the expected behavior of the clearMerged() method. In this case, the method should set all merged properties of the tiles to false.

    2. Create test cases that cover various scenarios, such as:
       a. Empty tiles array
       b. Null tiles array
       c. Empty rows
       d. Null rows
       e. Tiles with merged property set to true initially
       f. Tiles with merged property set to false initially

    3. For each test case, verify that the clearMerged() method behaves as expected when the mutated line is present.

    4. Remove the mutated line and re-run the test cases.

    5. If any test case fails, then you've found a test case that kills the mutant. Analyze the test case to understand why the absence of the line causes incorrect behavior.

    6. Once you've identified the test case that kills the mutant, you can refactor it to make it more effective and efficient.

    Remember, the goal is to create a comprehensive test suite that can detect as many mutants as possible. This approach will help you generate a test suite that can effectively kill various mutants, not just the one provided in this example.
