 First, we need to understand what the method does. It's responsible for drawing a tile on the grid based on its value. The value is used to determine the color of the tile and the position where it should be drawn.

    Now, let's focus on the mutated line. It seems that the value of the constant '121' has been changed to '0'. This change might affect the calculation of the position where the tile should be drawn.

    To generate a test suite that would kill this mutant, we need to create test cases that cover various scenarios and edge cases. Here are some suggestions:

    1. Test with valid grid coordinates (r, c) where the tile value is within the acceptable range. This will ensure that the tile is drawn at the correct position.
    2. Test with invalid grid coordinates (r, c) that are out of bounds or negative. This will ensure that the method doesn't throw an exception or draw anything outside the grid.
    3. Test with edge cases where the tile value is close to the minimum or maximum value. This will ensure that the color determination and position calculation work correctly for extreme values.
    4. Test with negative tile values. This will ensure that the method handles negative values correctly and doesn't throw an exception.
    5. Test with null or empty grid. This will ensure that the method handles such cases correctly and doesn't throw an exception.

    By creating test cases that cover these scenarios, we can ensure that the mutant is killed and the method behaves as expected. Remember, the goal is to create a comprehensive test suite that covers all possible edge cases and scenarios.
