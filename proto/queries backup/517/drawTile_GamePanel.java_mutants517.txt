 The mutated line is causing the calculation for the width of the text box to be multiplied instead of subtracted from the total width. This will result in the text being drawn outside the intended bounds, causing unexpected behavior.

 To generate tests that can potentially kill this mutant, we need to focus on the following aspects:

 1. Input validation: Ensure that the input values passed to the method are within the expected range and that the controller returns valid tiles.
 2. Edge cases: Test the method with the minimum and maximum possible values for the input parameters and check if the text is drawn correctly.
 3. Invalid input: Test the method with invalid input, such as negative values or null inputs, and check if the method behaves correctly.
 4. String length: Test the method with strings of varying lengths and check if the text is drawn correctly.
 5. ColorPalette: Test the method with different color palettes and check if the text color is set correctly based on the value.
 6. Font: Test the method with different fonts and check if the text is drawn correctly.

 To generate tests, you can use a testing framework like JUnit or TestNG. Write test cases that cover the above aspects and ensure that the method behaves correctly under different conditions. Remember, the goal is to find test cases that can expose the mutated line and cause the method to fail.

 In general, when generating tests for mutants, focus on the following principles:

 - Cover all possible input conditions.
 - Test the method with edge cases and boundary values.
 - Test the method with invalid inputs.
 - Test the method with different data structures and data types.
 - Test the method with different configurations and environments.

 By following these principles, you can generate a comprehensive test suite that can potentially kill mutants and ensure the correctness of your code.
