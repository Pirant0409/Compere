 First, we need to understand what this method does. It's responsible for drawing the grid and some text on the screen. The mutated line, marked as <NO-OP>, is a no-operation statement, which means it doesn't actually do anything. However, it's still part of the code, and it might affect the behavior of the method in some way.

 To generate a test suite that would kill this mutant, we need to find a test case that would expose the side-effects of this line. Side-effects are changes to the state of the program that are not directly related to the return value of a method. In this case, the side-effect we're interested in is the change in the color used for drawing the grid.

 Since the mutated line doesn't actually change the color, it's likely that the test case that was keeping the mutant alive was not checking the color of the grid after it was drawn. To create a test case that would kill the mutant, we need to add an assertion that checks the color of the grid after it's drawn.

 Here's a general approach to creating such a test case:

 1. Create a new JUnit test class for the `drawGridNotRunning` method.
 2. Initialize the necessary objects, such as a `Graphics2D` object and a `controller` object.
 3. Call the `drawGridNotRunning` method with the initialized objects.
 4. Add an assertion to check the color of the grid after it's drawn. This can be done by creating an image of the screen before and after the method call, and comparing the pixel values of the grid area in both images.
 5. Run the test case and observe the result. If the test passes, the mutant is dead. If it fails, you might need to refine the test case to make it more specific.

 Remember, the goal is not just to kill this particular mutant, but to create a test suite that would help prevent similar mutants from surviving in the future. This means creating tests that cover all the possible paths through the code, and checking for all the expected side-effects.
