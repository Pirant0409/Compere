 The mutated line is causing an issue by adding a constant value of 121 to the 'r' variable instead of multiplying it with 121. This results in an incorrect position for drawing the tile.

 To generate tests that can potentially kill this mutant, we need to focus on the part of the code where the position of the tile is being calculated. Here are some suggestions:

 1. Boundary testing: Test the method with the minimum and maximum possible values for the 'r' and 'c' parameters and observe the behavior. For example, try passing 0 and the maximum possible value for 'r' and 'c' respectively.

 2. Edge case testing: Test the method with values that are close to the boundaries but not exactly at them. For instance, try passing 1 and the maximum possible value for 'r' and 'c' respectively.

 3. Negative testing: Test the method with negative values for 'r' and 'c' to ensure that the method behaves correctly when given invalid input.

 4. Input validation testing: Check if the method correctly handles invalid input, such as non-numeric values or values outside the acceptable range.

 5. Interaction testing: Test the method in different scenarios, such as when multiple tiles are being drawn at the same time or when the grid size changes.

 6. Regression testing: Test the method after making changes to other parts of the code to ensure that the mutation doesn't affect the existing functionality.

 7. Code coverage testing: Use a code coverage tool to ensure that all parts of the method are being tested.

 8. Mutation testing: Use a mutation testing tool to automatically generate tests that target specific parts of the code, such as the mutated line.

 By following these testing strategies, you can generate a comprehensive test suite that can potentially kill the mutant and prevent similar issues from occurring in the future. Remember, the goal is to ensure that the code behaves correctly and consistently under various conditions.
