 The mutated line is causing the grid to be drawn incorrectly, but how exactly? Let's analyze the code.

    The method `drawGridRunning` is responsible for drawing the grid of the game. It does this by iterating through each cell in the grid and drawing either an empty cell or a cell with a tile. The `if` statement checks if the current cell is empty, and if so, it draws an empty cell. The `else` statement calls the `drawTile` method to draw a cell with a tile.

    The mutated line `row % 121` is causing the calculation of the x-coordinate of each cell to be incorrect. Instead of calculating the correct x-coordinate by multiplying the column index by the width of each cell and adding a constant offset, the mutated line is calculating the remainder of the row index divided by 121. This will result in the cells being drawn in the wrong positions.

    To generate a test suite that would kill this mutant, we need to write tests that check the correct positioning of each cell in the grid. Here's a general approach:

    1. Write a test case for each cell in the grid. This test case should verify that the cell is drawn in the correct position.
    2. Write a test case to verify that all cells are drawn correctly. This test case could check the position and size of all cells in the grid.
    3. Write a test case to verify that empty cells are drawn correctly. This test case could check the color and size of empty cells.
    4. Write a test case to verify that cells with tiles are drawn correctly. This test case could check the color and size of cells with tiles, as well as the position of the tile within the cell.

    By writing tests that check the correct positioning and drawing of each cell in the grid, we can ensure that the mutated line is killed and the grid is drawn correctly. This approach can be generalized to other mutants as well. The key is to write tests that cover all possible scenarios and edge cases, and to verify that the code behaves as expected under those conditions.
