 The mutated line is causing the method to calculate the column number incorrectly. The incorrect calculation is subtracting the side length instead of finding the remainder.

 To generate a test suite that would kill this mutant, we need to create test cases that would expose this incorrect behavior. Here's a general approach:

 1. Identify the boundary conditions: Find the minimum and maximum valid values for the pos parameter and create test cases for those values. For example, if the side length is 3, then the minimum valid value for pos would be 0 and the maximum would be 8 (3^2 - 1).

 2. Identify the edge cases: Create test cases for the edge cases, which are the values just before and just after the boundary conditions. For example, for the minimum value, create a test case for pos = -1, and for the maximum value, create a test case for pos = 9.

 3. Create test cases for invalid values: Create test cases for invalid values, such as negative numbers, zero, or values greater than the maximum valid value.

 4. Create test cases for special cases: Depending on the specifics of the GameParams and Tile classes, you might need to create test cases for special cases, such as when the tiles array is full or when the tile being set is null.

 5. Create test cases for the expected behavior: Create test cases for the expected behavior, where the method correctly sets the tile at the given position.

 6. Run the test suite: Execute the test suite and observe the results. If the mutant is still alive, then you need to refine your test cases to better expose the incorrect behavior. This might involve adding more test cases, changing the test data, or modifying the test cases to better cover the edge cases and boundary conditions.

 7. Repeat the process: If the mutant is not killed, then repeat the process, refining your test cases and adding new ones as needed.

 Remember, the goal is not just to kill this particular mutant, but to create a comprehensive test suite that would catch similar mutants in the future.
