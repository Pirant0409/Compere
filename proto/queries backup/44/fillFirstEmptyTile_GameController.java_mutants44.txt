 The mutated line is causing the for loop to iterate more times than intended, leading the method to process more positions than it should. This behavior might cause unexpected results, especially when the grid is not empty or the game parameters are not correctly set.

 To generate a test suite that would kill this mutant, you should focus on creating test cases that cover the edge cases and boundary conditions of the method. Here are some suggestions:

 1. Test when the grid is empty: Create a test case where the grid is initialized with no tiles, and call the fillFirstEmptyTile() method. The expected result is that the method should add a tile to the first empty position. If the mutant is alive, it might add more tiles than expected, leading to an incorrect state of the grid.

 2. Test when the grid is full: Create a test case where the grid is initialized with all tiles filled, and call the fillFirstEmptyTile() method. The expected result is that the method should return false, as there are no empty positions in the grid. If the mutant is alive, it might still try to add a tile, leading to an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException or other unexpected behavior.

 3. Test when the game parameters are incorrect: Create test cases where the sideLength of the GameParams is not a power of 2 or is less than 1. The expected result is that the method should throw an IllegalArgumentException, as the grid size should be a power of 2. If the mutant is alive, it might still try to iterate through the incorrect number of positions, leading to unexpected behavior.

 4. Test when the method is called multiple times: Create test cases where the fillFirstEmptyTile() method is called multiple times in a row. The expected result is that the method should add a tile to the first empty position each time it is called. If the mutant is alive, it might add more tiles than expected, leading to an incorrect state of the grid.

 5. Test when the method is called with different initial tile values: Create test cases where the method is called with different initial tile values for the grid. The expected result is that the method should add a tile with the correct value based on the conditions in the method. If the mutant is alive, it might add tiles with incorrect values, leading to unexpected behavior.

 By creating test cases that cover these edge cases and boundary conditions,
