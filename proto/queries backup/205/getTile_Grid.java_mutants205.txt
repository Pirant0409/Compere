 First, we need to understand what the mutated line does. It seems that the mutated line is using the multiplication operator instead of the modulo operator in the getTile method. This change might lead to out-of-bounds errors if the input row and column values are not properly checked.

    To generate a test suite that would kill this mutant, we need to create test cases that cover various edge cases and boundary values. Here are some suggestions:

    1. Test with valid row and column values that are within the bounds of the 2D array. For example, test with (0, 0), (0, GameParams.sideLength - 1), (GameParams.sideLength - 1, 0), and (GameParams.sideLength - 1, GameParams.sideLength - 1).
    2. Test with invalid row and column values that are out of bounds. For example, test with (-1, 0), (GameParams.sideLength, 0), (0, -1), and (GameParams.sideLength, GameParams.sideLength).
    3. Test with edge cases where the row or column value is equal to the side length. For example, test with (GameParams.sideLength, GameParams.sideLength), (GameParams.sideLength, 0), (0, GameParams.sideLength), and (0, GameParams.sideLength).
    4. Test with negative row and column values. For example, test with (-1, -1), (-1, 0), (0, -1), and (-1, GameParams.sideLength).
    5. Test with large positive row and column values. For example, test with (100, 100), (100, 0), (0, 100), and (100, GameParams.sideLength).

    By testing these cases, we can ensure that the getTile method behaves correctly even with the mutated line. If the mutant survives any of these test cases, we need to refine our test suite and add more test cases to cover the specific edge cases that the mutant is exploiting.

    In general, when generating a test suite for mutated code, it's important to cover various edge cases and boundary values. We should also test for negative and large input values, as well as combinations
