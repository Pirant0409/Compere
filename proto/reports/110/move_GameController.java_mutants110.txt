 The mutated line is causing the method to iterate one position less than it should. This means that the last position in the loop is not being checked for a possible move. To create a test case that would expose this issue, we need to create a scenario where the last position is the only valid move.

 First, let's make sure that the gamestate is running and that there is a tile at the last position. We can set up the grid with a single tile at the last position and call the method with the firstStartPos and lastStartPos set to the index of the first and last tile respectively.

 Next, we need to check that the method does not return true when it should. Since the mutated line causes the loop to terminate one position early, we can add an assertion that checks that the method does not return true when the last position is the only valid move.

 Here's a general approach to generating a test case for other mutants as well:

 1. Understand the behavior of the original code and the impact of the mutation.
 2. Create a scenario that exposes the issue caused by the mutation.
 3. Add assertions to check that the method behaves incorrectly in the scenario.
 4. Run the test case and verify that it fails.
 5. Refactor the test case to make it more robust and maintainable.

 Remember, the goal is not to kill this particular mutant, but to understand the thought process behind generating a test case that would expose the issue caused by the mutation.
