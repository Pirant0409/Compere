 First, we need to understand what the method does and how the mutated line affects it. The method "startGame()" initializes the game by resetting data, creating a new grid, and filling the first "GameParams.nbStartTileFilled" empty tiles with pieces. The mutated line is a no-op, which means it doesn't change the program's behavior. However, it's important to note that the mutated line is alive because some test cases are not able to detect its effect.

    To generate a test suite that can kill this mutant, we need to focus on testing the creation and initialization of the grid. Here are some suggestions for test cases:

    1. Test the case where the game is already running. This test case should not create a new grid, as the game state should not allow it.

    2. Test the case where the number of start tiles filled is greater than the total number of tiles in the grid. This test case should fail when trying to fill more tiles than exist.

    3. Test the case where the number of start tiles filled is less than the total number of tiles in the grid. This test case should ensure that all empty tiles are filled.

    4. Test the case where the grid is initialized with null or an incorrect size. This test case should check that the grid is properly initialized.

    5. Test the case where the fillFirstEmptyTile() method is not working correctly. This test case should ensure that the method correctly identifies and fills the first empty tile.

    6. Test the case where the grid is initialized with pieces of different types. This test case should ensure that the correct pieces are placed on the grid.

    7. Test the case where the grid is initialized with pieces of the same type. This test case should ensure that the pieces are placed in different locations.

    8. Test the case where the grid is initialized with pieces of the same type and the same location. This test case should ensure that the method correctly identifies and fills the first empty tile with a different piece.

    9. Test the case where the grid is initialized with pieces of the same type and the same location, and the method is called multiple times. This test case should ensure that all empty tiles are filled with different pieces.

    10. Test the case where the grid is initialized with pieces of the
