 The mutated line is causing the loop to iterate one more time than it should. This is because the value of 'step' is being decremented by 'nextPosIncr' instead of being multiplied by it. This results in the loop continuing even when the value of 'step' becomes negative.

 To create a test suite that would kill this mutant, we need to focus on the condition that causes the mutant to survive. In this case, it's the loop condition (step > 0). We want to ensure that this condition is not met when the mutated line is executed.

 To do this, we can create test cases that cover the edge cases where the value of 'step' is close to zero or negative. For example, we can test the method with the minimum and maximum possible values of 'firstStartPos', 'lastStartPos', 'startPosIncr', and 'nextPosIncr'. We can also test the method with 'step' initialized to zero or a negative value.

 By doing so, we can ensure that the test suite covers all possible scenarios where the mutated line might be executed and that the loop condition is not met in any of those scenarios. This will help us kill the mutant and prevent similar issues from occurring in the future.

 In general, when generating a test suite for mutated code, it's important to focus on the conditions that cause the mutant to survive and to create test cases that cover the edge cases and scenarios where those conditions are most likely to be met. This will help ensure that the test suite effectively covers the code and catches any potential issues.
