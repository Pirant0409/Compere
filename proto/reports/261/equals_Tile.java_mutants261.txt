 First, we need to understand the purpose of the method. It's an equals method, which is used to check if two objects are equal. In this case, the objects are instances of Tile class.

    To generate effective test cases, we need to consider the following scenarios:

    1. Null check: We should test if the method returns false when the other object is null.
    2. Self-check: We should test if the method returns true when the other object is the same instance of the current object.
    3. Different classes: We should test if the method returns false when the other object is an instance of a different class.
    4. Different values: We should test if the method returns false when the values of the two objects are different.
    5. Same values: We should test if the method returns true when the values of the two objects are the same.

    Now, let's analyze the mutated line. The mutated line returns true instead of false. This means that the method is not behaving as expected when the other object is an instance of the same class with a different value.

    To generate test cases that would kill this mutant, we need to create test cases that would make the method return false when it should. In this case, we need to create a test case where two different instances of Tile have the same value but different references.

    Here's a general approach to generate test cases for other mutants as well:

    1. Understand the purpose of the method and the expected behavior.
    2. Identify the scenarios that should make the method return a specific value.
    3. Create test cases that would make the method return the opposite value in each scenario.

    For example, if the mutated line in a method that adds two integers returns the sum of two integers plus one instead, we should create test cases where the sum of two integers is subtracted by one.

    Remember, the goal is to create test cases that cover all possible scenarios and edge cases to ensure the correctness of the code.
