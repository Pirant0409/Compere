 First, we need to understand what the original method does. The original method, clearMerged(), is simply calling another method clearMerged() on the grid object. This method is presumably responsible for clearing merged cells in the grid.

    Now, let's focus on the mutated line. A <NO-OP> statement is a no-operation statement, which does nothing. In this context, it seems that the mutated line has been added as a comment and does not affect the execution of the code. However, the fact that it has been kept alive by some test suite indicates that there might be some interaction between the mutated line and the rest of the code that we need to explore.

    To generate a test suite that would kill this mutant, we need to identify the conditions under which the mutated code behaves differently from the original code. Here are some steps you can follow:

    1. Analyze the code context: Look at the surrounding code, the method signature, and the class definition to understand the purpose of the clearMerged() method and the role of the grid object.

    2. Identify the preconditions: Determine the conditions that must be met before the clearMerged() method is called. This could include the state of the grid object, the input parameters, or the state of other objects in the system.

    3. Identify the postconditions: Determine the expected outcome of the clearMerged() method. This could include the state of the grid object or the behavior of other parts of the system.

    4. Design test cases: Based on the preconditions and postconditions, design test cases that exercise the clearMerged() method under various conditions. These test cases should cover different scenarios, such as empty grids, grids with merged cells, grids with invalid input, etc.

    5. Execute the test cases: Run the test cases and observe the behavior of the system. If the mutated code does not behave differently from the original code, then the test suite is not effective in killing the mutant. In this case, you may need to refine the test cases or add more tests to cover different scenarios.

    6. Repeat the process: Keep refining the test cases and executing them until the mutant is killed. Remember, the goal is not just to kill this particular mutant, but to build a robust test suite that can
