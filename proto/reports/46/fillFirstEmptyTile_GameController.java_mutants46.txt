 The mutated line is causing the for loop to iterate less times than it should. This means that the method may not be filling all the empty tiles in the grid. To generate a test suite that would kill this mutant, follow these steps:

1. Understand the method's behavior: The fillFirstEmptyTile() method is responsible for filling the first empty tile in the grid with a value. It checks each tile in the grid and fills the first empty one with a value based on certain conditions.

2. Identify the expected behavior: The expected behavior of the method is to fill all the empty tiles in the grid with a value.

3. Create test cases that cover edge cases and boundary conditions:
   a. Test when the grid is empty (no tiles filled initially).
   b. Test when there is only one empty tile.
   c. Test when there are multiple empty tiles.
   d. Test when the grid is full (all tiles are filled).
   e. Test when the grid size is 1x1.
   f. Test when the grid size is large (e.g., 10x10 or 100x100).

4. Create test cases that cover different tile values:
   a. Test when the method should fill a tile with a value of 2.
   b. Test when the method should fill a tile with a value of 4.

5. Create test cases that cover different grid configurations:
   a. Test when the empty tile is at the beginning of the grid.
   b. Test when the empty tile is at the end of the grid.
   c. Test when the empty tile is in the middle of the grid.
   d. Test when there are empty tiles in different positions.

6. Create test cases that cover different conditions:
   a. Test when tileAdded is a multiple of 10 and greater than 0.
   b. Test when tileAdded is not a multiple of 10 or less than 0.

7. Create test cases that cover different combinations of conditions:
   a. Test when there is an empty tile and tileAdded is a multiple of 10 and greater than 0.
   b. Test when there is an empty tile and tileAdded is not a multiple of 10 or less than 0.
