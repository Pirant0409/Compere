 First, we need to understand what this method does. It resets the data of the game, setting the score, highest score, game state, and tile added counter to their initial values.

    Now, let's focus on the mutated line. The mutated line is setting the score to a value less than zero, which is not valid for this game. This means that the mutant version of the method is not behaving as the original one.

    To generate a test suite that would kill this mutant, we need to create test cases that cover the following scenarios:

    1. Test the method when it is called with valid inputs. This will ensure that the method resets the data correctly when it is supposed to.
    2. Test the method when it is called with invalid inputs. In this case, we want to ensure that the method does not allow the score to be set to a negative value.

    To create test cases for the valid input scenario, we can write a test case that calls the method and checks that the data has been reset correctly. For example:

    ```java
    @Test
    public void testResetData() {
        Game game = new Game();
        game.resetData();
        assertEquals(0, game.getScore());
        assertEquals(0, game.getHighestScore());
        assertEquals(GameState.running, game.getGameState());
        assertEquals(0, game.getTileAdded());
    }
    ```

    To create a test case for the invalid input scenario, we can write a test case that tries to call the method with a negative score and checks that the score is not changed. For example:

    ```java
    @Test(expected = IllegalArgumentException.class)
    public void testResetDataWithNegativeScore() {
        Game game = new Game();
        game.resetData();
        game.setScore(-1); // This should not be possible after the method call
        fail("Expected an IllegalArgumentException when setting the score to a negative value.");
    }
    ```

    By writing test cases for both valid and invalid input scenarios, we can ensure that the method behaves correctly and does not allow the score to be set to a negative value, even in the presence of mutants.

    Remember, the key to generating effective test suites is to
