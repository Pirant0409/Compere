 First, we need to understand what this method does. It's called after a move is made in the game. The method checks if the current highest score equals or exceeds the target score. If it does, the game state is set to "won". If not, the method clears any merged tiles, fills the first empty tile, and checks if there are any moves left. If there are no moves left, the game state is set to "over".

 Now, let's focus on the mutated line. A <NO-OP> mutation means that the code at that line has been changed to do nothing. In this case, the line that was mutated is the one where the game state is set to "won". This means that the mutated version of the method doesn't change the game state when the highest score equals the target score.

 To generate a test suite that would kill this mutant, we need to create test cases that cover all possible scenarios where the game state should be set to "won". Here are some steps to help you get started:

 1. Identify all the inputs or conditions that can lead to the highest score equaling the target score. For example, if the target score is 100 and the highest score is initially 99, what move or sequence of moves could make the highest score equal 100?

 2. Create test cases that cover these scenarios. For each test case, make sure to set up the initial state of the game, make the move or sequence of moves that should result in the highest score equaling the target score, and then verify that the game state is indeed set to "won".

 3. Make sure to also test the negative scenarios, where the highest score is less than the target score or the moves available are insufficient to reach the target score. These test cases will help ensure that the method behaves correctly when the conditions for winning are not met.

 4. Finally, run your test suite against the mutated version of the method. If the test suite is effective, it should reveal that the mutated version of the method is not behaving correctly and the game state is not being set to "won" when it should be.

 Remember, the goal is not just to kill this particular mutant, but to create a robust test suite that can detect and prevent similar mutations in the future. By following these steps
