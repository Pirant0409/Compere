 First, we need to understand the behavior of the original method and the mutated line.

    The original method `mergeWith` takes another `Tile` object as an argument and merges the values of the two tiles if they can be merged. The method returns the new value of the merged tile. The line `setMerged(true)` sets the merged flag of the current tile to true, indicating that it has been merged with another tile.

    The mutated line `<NO-OP>` is a no-operation statement, which does nothing. It doesn't change the state of the program or the variables.

    To generate a test suite that would kill this mutant, we need to find a test case that would expose the difference in behavior between the original and the mutated method. In other words, we need to find a test case that would rely on the `setMerged(true)` line in the original method and would fail if this line is removed.

    Here are some steps to guide you in generating such a test case:

    1. Identify the preconditions and postconditions of the method. Preconditions are the conditions that must be true before the method is called, and postconditions are the conditions that must be true after the method is called. In this case, the precondition is that the two tiles can be merged, and the postcondition is that the merged tile has the correct value and merged flag.

    2. Create test cases that cover different scenarios, including edge cases and negative scenarios. For example, you could test merging two tiles with the same value, merging two tiles with different values, merging two tiles with zero value, and merging two tiles with negative values.

    3. For each test case, check the expected behavior of the method before and after the mutation. If the expected behavior changes after the mutation, then you have found a test case that would expose the difference in behavior between the original and the mutated method.

    4. Write test cases that rely on the `setMerged(true)` line in the original method. For example, you could write a test case that checks the merged flag of the tile after merging with another tile. If the merged flag is not set to true after merging, then the test case would fail.

    5. Write test cases that check the side effects of the method. For
