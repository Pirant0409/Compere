 The mutated line changes the logical OR operator to a logical XOR operator. This means that the method will now return true only if exactly one of the two tiles is merged.

 To generate a test suite that would kill this mutant, you need to find test cases that would cause the method to return a different result than what it originally did.

 First, let's consider the original behavior of the method. It returns true if both tiles are not merged. So, we need test cases where both tiles are not merged and the method should return true.

 Next, let's consider the mutated behavior of the method. It returns true if exactly one of the two tiles is merged. So, we need test cases where one tile is merged and the other is not, and the method should return false.

 Now, let's think about how we can create such test cases. We can create two Tile objects and set the isMerged property of one of them to true. Then, we can call the canMergeWith method with these two tiles as arguments and check if the method returns the expected result.

 To make sure that our test suite is comprehensive, we should also consider edge cases and negative test cases. For example, we should test what happens when both tiles are null, or when one tile is null and the other is not. We should also test what happens when both tiles have the same value, or when they have different values but are still mergeable.

 In summary, to generate a test suite that would kill this mutant, you should create test cases that cover the original and mutated behavior of the method, as well as edge cases and negative test cases. You should also make sure that your test cases are independent, meaning that each test case should only depend on the method under test and not on any other method or state.

 Remember, the goal is not just to kill this particular mutant, but to create a comprehensive test suite that would catch similar mutants in the future. So, always think about the different ways that a method can behave and create test cases that cover those scenarios.
