 First, we need to understand the behavior of the method `canMergeWith(other)` and its impact on the `mergeWith` method.

    The `canMergeWith` method is presumably checking some conditions for merging two tiles. If the condition is met, it returns `true`, otherwise `false`. The `mergeWith` method checks if `canMergeWith` returns `true` before performing the merge operation.

    To generate tests that can potentially kill this mutant, we need to focus on the conditions that `canMergeWith` checks. We should create test cases that cover various scenarios where the merging condition is not met.

    Here are some guidelines to generate test cases:

    1. Test with null tiles: Create a test case where one or both tiles passed to the `mergeWith` method are `null`.
    2. Test with different tile types: If the `Tile` class has different types, create test cases where the types of the tiles do not match.
    3. Test with conflicting values: Create test cases where the sum of the values of the two tiles would result in a value that exceeds the maximum limit or underflows.
    4. Test with conflicting merged states: Create test cases where one or both tiles have already been merged.
    5. Test with conflicting dimensions: If the `Tile` class has dimensions, create test cases where the dimensions of the tiles do not match.

    By creating test cases that cover these scenarios, we increase the chances of finding a test case that kills the mutant. Remember, the goal is not just to kill this particular mutant but to ensure the entire codebase is well-tested.

    Additionally, it's important to note that the test cases should be designed to be independent, meaning each test case should test a single condition or scenario. This makes it easier to identify which test case caused the failure when a test does not pass.

    Lastly, it's essential to ensure that the test cases are executed in a systematic order. This can be achieved by organizing the test cases in a test suite or a test class and running them in a specific order.

    In summary, to generate tests that can potentially kill a mutant, we need to understand the behavior of the method and focus on the conditions that can cause the method to return unexpected results. We should create test cases that cover various scenarios
