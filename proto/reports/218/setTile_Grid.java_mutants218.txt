 The mutated line is causing an issue, and we want to create tests that will expose this issue.

    First, we need to understand what the original code does. The original code calculates the row and column of a given position in a 2D grid. The side length of the grid is defined by a constant named GameParams.sideLength.

    Now, let's see what the mutated line does. Instead of calculating the row, it calculates the column. This means that the tiles will be placed in the wrong position in the grid.

    To create tests that will expose this issue, we need to think about different scenarios where this incorrect placement can cause problems. Here are some ideas:

    1. Test placing a tile at a position that should be out of bounds (a position with a row or column greater than the side length). The original code should not allow this, but the mutated code might.
    2. Test placing a tile at a position that should be inside the grid but with incorrect row and column values due to the mutated line.
    3. Test placing multiple tiles at the same position, which should not be allowed by the original code but might be allowed by the mutated code.
    4. Test the behavior of the grid when tiles are placed using the mutated code and then other methods are called that depend on the correct positioning of the tiles.

    To create tests for these scenarios, you can write test cases that call the setTile method with different input positions and verify the expected behavior of the grid. For example, you can create a test case that checks if a tile is placed at the correct position, or if an exception is thrown when trying to place a tile out of bounds.

    Remember, the goal is to create a comprehensive test suite that covers as many scenarios as possible, not just the one that exposes the mutated line. This will help ensure the overall correctness of the code.
