 The mutated line is causing the method to fill more tiles than intended during the game initialization. This could lead to unexpected behavior, such as overlapping tiles or exceeding the grid size.

 To generate a test suite that would kill this mutant, you should focus on creating test cases that cover the edge cases and boundary conditions of the method. Here's a general approach:

 1. Test the method with the minimum number of tiles to be filled (i.e., GameParams.nbStartTileFilled = 0). This test case should ensure that the method does not fill any tile when the game state is not running.

 2. Test the method with the maximum number of tiles to be filled (i.e., GameParams.nbStartTileFilled = Integer.MAX_VALUE). This test case should ensure that the method does not fill more tiles than the grid size can accommodate.

 3. Test the method with the exact number of tiles to be filled (i.e., GameParams.nbStartTileFilled = someValue). This test case should ensure that the method fills the exact number of tiles as specified in the game parameters.

 4. Test the method with the game state set to different values (i.e., GameState.paused, GameState.won, etc.). This test case should ensure that the method does not fill any tiles when the game state is not running.

 5. Test the method with the grid size set to different values. This test case should ensure that the method does not fill more tiles than the grid size can accommodate.

 6. Test the method with different initial game states (i.e., filled tiles in different positions). This test case should ensure that the method fills the first empty tile correctly, regardless of the initial game state.

 7. Test the method with different fill strategies (i.e., random, left-to-right, top-to-bottom, etc.). This test case should ensure that the method fills the tiles in the correct order according to the chosen strategy.

 8. Test the method with different game parameters (i.e., grid size, number of start tiles filled, etc.). This test case should ensure that the method behaves correctly with different game configurations.

 By creating test cases that cover these edge cases and boundary conditions, you will be able to generate a test suite that can effectively
