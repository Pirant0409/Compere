 The mutated line is causing an arithmetic exception because we're trying to get the remainder of a number by 1 when the number is not an integer. This is causing an issue in the for loop where we're trying to iterate from step = GameParams.sideLength - 1 down to 0.

    To create a test suite that would kill this mutant, we need to focus on the following areas:

    1. Identify the input that causes the mutation to manifest. In this case, it's the value of GameParams.sideLength.
    2. Create test cases that cover the edge cases and boundary values of GameParams.sideLength.
    3. Create test cases that cover the normal flow of the method, but with the mutated value of GameParams.sideLength.

    Here's a general approach to generate test cases:

    a. Create a test case for the normal flow of the method with a valid value of GameParams.sideLength. This test case should cover the scenario where the method successfully moves a tile and updates the score.

    b. Create a test case for the edge case where GameParams.sideLength is 0. This test case should verify that the method returns false and doesn't attempt to iterate through the for loop.

    c. Create a test case for the edge case where GameParams.sideLength is 1. This test case should verify that the method returns false and doesn't attempt to iterate through the for loop.

    d. Create a test case for the boundary value where GameParams.sideLength is the maximum integer value. This test case should verify that the method returns the expected result and doesn't throw any exceptions.

    e. Create a test case for the mutated value where GameParams.sideLength is not an integer. This test case should verify that the method throws an exception or returns false and doesn't attempt to iterate through the for loop.

    By covering these test cases, we can ensure that the mutation is killed and the method behaves correctly for all valid and invalid inputs. Remember, the goal is to test the behavior of the method when it encounters unexpected inputs, such as the mutated value of GameParams.sideLength.
