 First, we need to understand the behavior of the original method. The method `fillFirstEmptyTile()` is responsible for filling the first empty tile in the grid with a value. The value to be filled depends on certain conditions. If the number of tiles added is a multiple of 10, then the value is 4. Otherwise, the value is 2.

    Now, let's analyze the mutated line. The mutated line is a no-op statement, which means it doesn't change the value of the variable `val`. This mutation doesn't affect the method's behavior directly, but it might indirectly impact the program's behavior by changing the interaction between this method and other parts of the codebase.

    To generate a test suite that would kill this mutant, we need to focus on the conditions that cause the value of `val` to be 4. We want to create test cases that ensure the method behaves correctly when these conditions are met.

    Here are some steps to generate test cases:

    1. Identify the conditions that cause the value of `val` to be 4. In this case, the condition is `this.tileAdded >= 0 && this.tileAdded % 10 == 0`.
    2. Create test cases that cover these conditions. For example, you can test the method with a grid of size 10x10 and add 10, 20, 30, ... tiles to it. This way, you can ensure that the method sets the value to 4 when the condition is met.
    3. Create test cases that cover the opposite conditions. For example, you can test the method with a grid of size 10x10 and add 1, 2, 3, ... tiles to it. This way, you can ensure that the method sets the value to 2 when the condition is not met.
    4. Create test cases that cover edge cases. For example, you can test the method with a grid of size 3x3 and add 3, 6, 9 tiles to it. This way, you can ensure that the method behaves correctly when the number of tiles added is close to being a multiple of 10.
    5. Create test cases that cover the interaction between this method and other parts of the codebase. For example, you can
