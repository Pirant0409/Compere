 First, we need to understand the behavior of the method. The method `fillFirstEmptyTile()` is trying to fill the first empty tile in the grid with a value. It checks each position in the grid to see if it's empty, and if it is, it sets the tile at that position to a new Tile with a value of either 2 or 4, depending on some condition.

    Now, let's focus on the mutated line. The mutated line returns `false` instead of `true`. This means that the method is not filling any tile, even when there is an empty one available.

    To generate a test suite that would kill this mutant, we need to create test cases that cover all possible scenarios where the method should fill a tile. Here are some suggestions:

    1. Test when the grid is empty: Create a test case where the grid is initialized with no tiles, and call the `fillFirstEmptyTile()` method. The expected result is that the method should fill the first empty tile with a value of 2.

    2. Test when there is only one empty tile: Create a test case where the grid has only one empty tile, and call the `fillFirstEmptyTile()` method. The expected result is that the method should fill the empty tile with a value of 2.

    3. Test when there are multiple empty tiles: Create a test case where the grid has multiple empty tiles, and call the `fillFirstEmptyTile()` method. The expected result is that the method should fill the first empty tile it encounters with a value of 2.

    4. Test when the condition for a value of 4 is met: Create a test case where the condition for a value of 4 is met (i.e., `tileAdded` is a multiple of 10), and call the `fillFirstEmptyTile()` method. The expected result is that the method should fill the first empty tile it encounters with a value of 4.

    5. Test when the grid is full: Create a test case where the grid is full, and call the `fillFirstEmptyTile()` method. The expected result is that the method should return false, since there are no empty tiles left to fill.

    By creating test cases that cover all these scenarios, we can ensure that the method behaves correctly and kills the mut
