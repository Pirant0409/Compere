 First, we need to understand the behavior of the original method. The method `fillFirstEmptyTile()` is responsible for filling the first empty tile in the grid with a value. It checks each position in the grid to see if it's empty, and if it is, it sets the tile at that position with a value. The value depends on certain conditions, such as the number of tiles already added.

    Now, let's focus on the mutated line. The mutated line is `-1`, which is not valid Java code. It seems that the mutation process went wrong, and we cannot directly use this line to create a test case. Instead, we should try to understand what the mutation was intended to do.

    To generate effective test cases, we need to consider the following aspects:
    1. Input: What are the valid and invalid inputs for the method?
    2. Preconditions: What are the conditions that must be met before the method can be called?
    3. Postconditions: What are the expected outputs or side effects of the method?
    4. Edge cases: What are the extreme or unusual inputs that can test the method's limits?

    Based on the given code, we can identify some test cases that would help us ensure the method's correctness:

    Test Case 1: Empty Grid
        Input: An empty grid (all tiles are null)
        Expected Output: The method should fill the first empty tile with a value of 2

    Test Case 2: Filled Grid with No Empty Tiles
        Input: A filled grid (all tiles are not null)
        Expected Output: The method should return false

    Test Case 3: Filled Grid with Empty Tile
        Input: A filled grid with one empty tile
        Expected Output: The method should fill the empty tile with a value of 2

    Test Case 4: Filled Grid with Empty Tile and Condition Met
        Input: A filled grid with one empty tile and the condition for a 4 is met
        Expected Output: The method should fill the empty tile with a value of 4

    Test Case 5: Edge Case: Empty Grid with Negative Position
        Input: An empty grid and a negative position
        Expected Output: The method should not throw an exception and
