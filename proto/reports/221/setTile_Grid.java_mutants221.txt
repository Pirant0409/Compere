 The mutated line is causing the method to calculate an incorrect row number. The incorrect row number is leading to the mutant surviving the test suite. To generate a test suite that would kill this mutant, we need to focus on testing the correctness of the row calculation.

 First, we need to identify the conditions under which the mutant is surviving. Based on the mutated line, it seems that the method is trying to set a tile outside the grid. This means that the input pos is larger than the maximum allowed value for the grid.

 To test this condition, we can create a test case that sets a tile at a position beyond the grid boundaries. For example, we can test the method with a pos value of (GameParams.sideLength * GameParams.sideLength) + 1. This test case should fail if the method correctly handles the out-of-bounds condition and should pass if the mutant is allowing the method to set a tile outside the grid.

 Once we have identified a test case that fails with the mutant, we can add more test cases to cover other edge cases and normal cases. For example, we can test the method with valid positions within the grid boundaries, positions at the edges of the grid, and positions that are just beyond the edges but still within the allowed range.

 To ensure that our test suite is effective, we can also add negative test cases that test the method with invalid inputs, such as a negative pos value or a null tile argument.

 By thoroughly testing the method under various conditions, we can increase the chances of finding and killing the mutant. Remember, the goal is not just to kill this particular mutant but to ensure that the method is functioning correctly under all conditions.

 In general, to generate a test suite for a method, follow these steps:
1. Understand the method's functionality and expected behavior.
2. Identify the conditions under which the method may fail or behave unexpectedly.
3. Create test cases that cover these conditions, including edge cases and negative test cases.
4. Execute the test suite and analyze the results to identify any failures or unexpected behavior.
5. Refine the test suite by adding more test cases as needed to cover additional conditions or edge cases.
6. Repeat the testing process until all test cases pass and the method is functioning correctly.
